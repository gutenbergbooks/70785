<small>THE FALCON FINDS A FRIEND</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">A LONG freight train, westward bound, came to
a stop in a little California mountain town
with a shriek of brakes and a hiss of air. At once
a brakeman clambered agilely down the steel ladder
of a box car in the middle of the train, and sent the
side door of the car creaking along its rusty track.
He thrust his head inside and peered about through
the darkness of the interior.</p>

<p>Then he cried raucously:</p>

<p>“Come outa that, now! Make it snappy, Jack!”</p>

<p>In a dark corner of the box car a man arose
and stepped slowly toward the square of sunlight
that represented the door. As the light of day
shone in upon him the brakeman looked him up
and down, and did not seem so displeased.</p>

<p>The tramp was dressed in overalls, fairly decent
shoes, and a cap. Though he was grimy and
stained from hours of travel on a freight, he was
no dirtier than the brakeman and was dressed as
well. His hair was close-cropped, and no stubble
of beard showed on his rather boyish face. His
eyes were dark and twinkling. His figure was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
straight and strong. There was nothing hangdog
about this tramp.</p>

<p>The brakeman’s tones were mollified as he asked:</p>

<p>“Where you goin’, Jack?”</p>

<p>“West.”</p>

<p>“Uh-huh. I know that. What’re you ridin’ on?”</p>

<p>“I’m broke.”</p>

<p>“Yeah? You don’t look it. You look like a
workin’man.”</p>

<p>“I am.”</p>

<p>“What d’ye follow?”</p>

<p>“Railroad-construction work.”</p>

<p>“Huh! A stiff, eh?”</p>

<p>“Yes—a stiff.”</p>

<p>The “shack” was silent a little. Then seeming
to have decided the point under contemplation:</p>

<p>“Well, slide out. Guess it’s time for you to eat
anyway. But I’ll let you ride out the division for
a dollar.”</p>

<p>“Sorry, but I haven’t a dollar. Thanks, though.”</p>

<p>“Four bits, then.”</p>

<p>“Simply haven’t a cent.”</p>

<p>“Well, then unload—and beat it!”</p>

<p>The tramp sat down in the door, dangled his
feet, and dropped lightly to the ground.</p>

<p>“So long!” he said, and strode away beside the
train, his hands in his trouser pockets.</p>

<p>“Humph!” snorted the brakeman, and gave the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
door a vicious shove that forced a protesting scream
from the track and rollers.</p>

<p>The little town was six thousand five hundred
feet above the sea, in the high Sierras. The breath
of pines came to the vagabond’s nostrils as he
trudged along. A dynamic trout stream plunged
over and around huge boulders on its frenzied race
to the blue Pacific, two hundred miles away. The
rare air of the high altitude, to which the traveler
was unaccustomed, sent the blood pounding through
his veins; and despite the beginning of hunger
pangs his spirits were elated and his step elastic
as he walked on toward the village.</p>

<p>Before he reached even its outskirts he saw five
men—tramps like himself, no doubt—in camp beside
the rushing stream. The odor of cooking came to
his sensitive nostrils. He had only to climb down
a twenty-foot fill, crawl through the right-of-way
fence, and try his luck. He had fed dozens of
fellow wanderers, while his money lasted, since he
had left the State of Kansas. He had been
penniless, now, only since the day before. He
realized that he might not be welcome in this
hobo camp, for he had long since learned that the
so-called tramp fraternity is a figment of the imagination.
But the mountain air had made him
desperately hungry—his money had fed many of
the class down there in camp—it was time for at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
least a part of his bread cast upon the waters
to drift into an eddy and start floating back.</p>

<p>He scrambled down, forked himself between the
strands of barbed wire, and boldly approached the
source of those savory odors.</p>

<p>That this was a permanent hobo camp was evident
from the many blackened cans that lay about,
the cold ashes of ancient camp fires, and the carvings
on the trees that shaded the rendezvous.</p>

<p>One man stooped over the fire and stirred a large
can of boiling Mexican beans. Another was cutting
into slices a loaf of bread with his pocketknife,
hacking to the center on one side, then turning
the loaf to complete the cuts, by reason of the
shortness of the blade. Three others lounged on
the ground, smoked and whittled, and eyed the
newcomer with disapproval.</p>

<p>“How are you, fellows?” the “buttinsky” said,
smiling and seating himself on a moss-covered
stone.</p>

<p>No one replied, but the man who was cutting
the bread looked up and grinned.</p>

<p>He was about the newcomer’s age, and had a
clean, lean face with distinct freckles on it and on
his neck. His hair was sandy and kinky, and a
comb and brush would have made no change whatever
in its wiry appearance. His eyes were blue
and friendly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>The stranger at once sensed that this man was
of a different type from his four companions.
Though a tramp, there were about him no marks
of the confirmed John Yegg. The others were old-timers
of the oldest known school.</p>

<p>“Going to have a little feed, eh?” innocently
remarked the new arrival. “I smelled those beans
cooking a hundred yards away.”</p>

<p>The old-timers looked from one to another in
blank amazement. “Can you beat it?” was the
question their looks expressed. Then with a great
sigh as of resignation to the demands of a stern
duty, one of them rose and fumbled in a pocket
of his grease-salvaged vest.</p>

<p>He extracted a dirty match, looked it over with
owl-like wisdom, and, stepping around the fire, silently
passed it to the newcomer.</p>

<p>At least four pairs of cold eyes watched this
pantomime. The man who had been offered the
match took it mechanically, and looked up into the
donor’s face.</p>

<p>“Seems to me I get you,” he said, a trifle embarrassed.
“I’ve heard of a tramp’s being given
the match in a camp where he’s not wanted. It’s
a subtle suggestion, I believe, for him to go elsewhere
and build a camp fire of his own, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Ol’-timer,” the donor of the match said sneeringly,
“youse’re right. Dat means ‘Beat it!’—and
dis means ‘Beat it quick!’—see?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>He lifted a clenched fist for the other’s inspection.</p>

<p>“Oh, I get you,” the unwelcome visitor replied,
rising from the stone. “I’ll beat it, of course. But
don’t labor under the delusion that what you’ve
just held up has anything to do with it.”</p>

<p>He turned, thrust his hands into his pockets again,
and started back toward the right of way.</p>

<p>“Wait a minnit, Jack!”</p>

<p>The ejected one turned. It was the bread slicer
who had spoken.</p>

<p>“C’mon back here an’ dig in on the bread an’
beans, ol’-timer,” he invited. “You’re as welcome
as the flowers in May. I happen to know, for the
simple reason that I’m the Jasper that bungled up
for the pinks and the punk myself. I’m entertainin’
to-day.”</p>

<p>The man who had passed the match turned on
him with a snarl.</p>

<p>“Wot’s de idear, ‘Halfaman’? Do youse want
every farmer on de line to come buttin’ in on yer
scoffin’s? Youse gi’me a pain, Jack!”</p>

<p>“Aw, go get in yer kennel and gnaw yer bone,
‘Blister’!” retorted the bread-and-beans magnate.
“You ole fuzzy tails get my goat. You wouldn’t
give a man a crumb o’ tobacco; but I notice you’re
always the first one to butt in yerself when anybody
else has scoffin’s. I buys them pinks and I
buys this punk; and all that any o’ you stiffs furnished
for this little picnic was the salt ‘Monk o’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
the Rum’ swiped from the grocer while I was gettin’
the beans. I’ll do the sayin’ who’s to scoff in
this camp. C’mon back here, ol’-timer, and dig in!”</p>

<p>“Sinful Blister,” which was the weird moniker
of the dissenter, slouched back to his seat on the
ground, muttering discontentedly. The other John
Yeggs shrugged indifferently, in full sympathy with
the Blister, but diplomatically acceding to the wishes
of him who had bought the beans.</p>

<p>The now invited guest returned, and the cook
poured out the beans into smaller tin cans and
silently passed one to him. The one designated as
Halfaman thrust two slices of bread into the other’s
hands, and into other cans poured black coffee.</p>

<p>For a space the six ate in silence, the stranger
from time to time glancing at his benefactor as if
he wished to thank him, but could not find the
words.</p>

<p>“Where you headin’ for, Jack?” Halfaman presently
asked, his freckled cheeks shuttling over jaw-bones
that oversaw the mastication of huge portions
of food.</p>

<p>“West,” was the short reply.</p>

<p>“What d’ye follow when ye’re followin’?”</p>

<p>“I’m hunting construction work.”</p>

<p>“Dirt or rock?”</p>

<p>“Either.”</p>

<p>“That’s me; I’m a stiff. Was you beatin’ it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
down to the desert? There’s a big job openin’ up
down there.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I heard about that. The Gold Belt Cut-off,
eh?”</p>

<p>“That’s her, I’m makin’ it down there. I know
lots o’ contractors that’ll have jobs on the road.”</p>

<p>The other ate in silence for a space, as if thinking
deeply. “I don’t know but I’ll try to get down
there, too,” he said presently. “I wasn’t exactly
headed for any particular place.”</p>

<p>“She oughta be a good job. There’s good men’ll
be down there. First thing I c’n ketch goin’ west
takes me.”</p>

<p>“Do—do you mind if I go along with you?”
hesitatingly asked the other.</p>

<p>“I should say not! I don’t like ramblin’ alone.
Never did. I get to talkin’ to meself. Sure—we’ll
make it out together. What’s yer moniker, Jack?”</p>

<p>Again the stranger hesitated. Then a little red
crept into his face as he replied: “They call me
‘The Falcon.’”</p>

<p>One of the John Yeggs snorted softly and winked
at a companion. It was quite plain to him that the
speaker knew little about hobos’ monikers and such
things.</p>

<p>“Been followin’ construction work long?” asked
Halfaman.</p>

<p>“Virtually all my life,” returned the other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>At this another of the listeners sighed wearily,
and whispered to one near him:</p>

<p>“Get dat, will youse? Been follyin’ de big camps
all his life! C’n youse beat it? I’m bettin’ he
never seen a railroad camp—hey? No foolin’!”</p>

<p>His friend nodded with a grimace that showed
agreement.</p>

<p>When he had finished eating, the new friend of
The Falcon rose, and, lying flat, took a long drink
from the cold mountain stream.</p>

<p>“Well,” he announced, “I’m beatin’ ’er up to
the tracks. C’mon, if you’re goin’ with me, Jack.
There’s a westbound freight due before so very
long, if the switchman didn’t lie—and he didn’t
look like he had brains enough to lie.”</p>

<p>“Much obliged for de scoffin’s, Halfaman,” volunteered
one of the tramps as The Falcon followed
the freckled youth through the fence.</p>

<p>“Keep the change!” called Halfaman. “But next
time I’m settin’ up the eats, le’ me do the invitin’.”</p>

<p>There was no answer; and the two struggled
up the hill, and walked along the track toward a
water tank to hide and wait the coming of the
next westbound freight.</p>

<p>They reached the tank and sat down on the
ground behind it, resting their backs against the
pedestals. Halfaman removed a greasy cap with a
broken visor, and laid it in his lap, allowing the
cool mountain breeze to play with the kinks of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
his sandy hair. He had a way of talking out of
one corner of his good-natured and rather wide
mouth which amused the reticent Falcon.</p>

<p>“You ain’t been on the road long, have you,
kid?” he said kindly.</p>

<p>“Why do you say that?”</p>

<p>“You might just as well be wearin’ a card on
yer breast, like a blind man does, tellin’ the world
about it,” said Halfaman. “Le’ me tell you sumpin.
You don’t wanta go buttin’ into hobo camps like
you did back there. Them old Jaspers hate themselves.
They got no use fer the likes o’ you.”</p>

<p>“But you’re not like them.”</p>

<p>“I should say I ain’t! I’m a construction stiff.
They’re just stiff. I’m a tramp, but I work. They
don’t unless they have to—see? I was buyin’ some
pinks and punk to cook up for myself—see?—and
they butts in on me and gets me for a feed.
I never turn a stiff down if I got anything, so I
told ’em to come on an’ bust ’emselves. I know
two of ’em—‘Sinful Blister’ and ‘Monk o’ the
Rum.’ The other two’s pals o’ theirs. I’ll feed
anybody—gaycat, yegg, bindle-stiff, skinner, mucker,
or dyno. But I want ’em to feed me when I’m
broke, too. I got no use for the likes o’ them
back there. I’m a decent tramp—get me?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied The Falcon. “I try to be that
myself. That’s why I approached the camp. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
thought maybe I’d be treated like I’ve treated
dozens of others since I started West.”</p>

<p>“And wasn’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes—by you. And I’ll not forget it. Stay by
me—if you like me—and you’ll never regret what
you did for me to-day.”</p>

<p>The other studied him openly. “I don’t quite
get your number,” he stated. “Your hands ain’t
the hands of a workin’ stiff, and you talk kinda
like you knew how. You say you been followin’
construction camps all yer life?”</p>

<p>“That’s what I said.”</p>

<p>“But you was lyin’.”</p>

<p>“Well, the way you say that, I can’t resent it,
of course. Anyway, I call myself a railroad stiff.
Accept it as truth, or don’t—it makes little difference
to me. I may be raw—I guess I am—but
you stick with me and I’ll pay you for that dinner.”</p>

<p>“Don’t do it till I ask for it,” retorted the other,
cupping a hand back of one of his prominent ears
and listening up the track.</p>

<p>He arose and went to the two lines of steel,
sprawling flat and holding an ear to a rail.</p>

<p>“I hear her singin’ to me,” he announced, returning.
“She’ll be here in a minnit. Now that
moniker of yours.” He stood before the tank
looking at the many carvings thereon. “I don’t
see it here, f’r instance. Get up an’ I’ll show you
mine. Cut ’er there three years ago, when I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
was ramblin’ east, ridin’ through the snowsheds,
stretched out on the backs of a car o’ sheep to keep
warm. Some bed if it don’t lay down under you!”</p>

<p>The Falcon had risen and stood looking up to
where the other pointed. In neat carving, on one
of the wooden pedestals, he saw:</p>

<p class="center">HALFAWAY DAISY<br>
1917, BOUND EAST<br>
PHINEHAS BEGAT ABISHUA</p>

<p>“That’s an odd name,” remarked The Falcon.
“And the quotation?”</p>

<p>“Well, by golly, it ain’t any odder’n my real
one, ol’-timer! Daisy’s me right name; and as if
that wasn’t funny enough the old folks slipped me
a Bible name—Phinehas. Phinehas Daisy—c’n you
beat it? I’m one o’ the begatters.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?” asked The Falcon, the lips of
his grave mouth twitching in amusement.</p>

<p>“Ain’t you never read the Bible?”</p>

<p>“Not as much as I ought, perhaps.”</p>

<p>“Well, the begatters, as I call ’em are in the
Bible. I learned that part by heart till it got
down to me. It goes like this: ‘And the children
of Amram; Aaron, and Moses, and Miriam.
The sons also of Aaron; Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar
and Ithamar. Eleazar begat Phinehas. Phinehas
begat Abishua.’ Didn’t you ever read that?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>“Yes, I suppose so. Rather dry in there, I
thought.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m Phinehas. I’m one o’ the begatters—see?
But the bos they call me Halfaman. That’s
pretty raw, too. See how they got it on me?
I gotta be square all the time, or folks will think
I’m only half a man because they call me that.
I used to have a pal, and his right name was Holman
Rose. Wasn’t that funny?—Rose and Daisy!
Sometimes they called us ‘The Bouquet.’ And
then, seein’ his name was Holman, they called me
Halfaman. Maybe they’re right, but I never refused
a guy a feed when I had it. Here she comes,
Falcon. Now you do just what I tell you to, and
we’ll make ’er out easy, and ride ’er clean to the
desert—if we’re lucky. Believe me, ole Falcon,
I’m a ramblin’ yegg when I get started!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br>

<small>“SQUAWTOOTH” CANBY</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE village of Opaco, on the fringe of the big
California desert, never in all its day had seen
such frenzied activity. Ninety miles to the east
over the wastes of sand, yuccas, greasewood, and
cacti, the engineers of a railroad company had
made the preliminary survey of the proposed Gold
Belt Cut-off, and every indication pointed to the
fact that Opaco would be the natural source of
supply for the big camps that would come to build
the road.</p>

<p>Even now one of the construction companies was
temporarily in their midst, while they unloaded
their outfit of tents and tools and horses and
wagons innumerable from the sidetracked freight
train that had brought it to Opaco. The local
livery stable and its accompanying corrals were
taxed to the limit to minister to the stock. More
than fifty strange men, who spoke in the argot
of tramps, labored at unloading the train and piling
which they removed in big mountain wagons against
the ninety-mile trip to Squawtooth Ranch, the outfit’s
camping place. The two hotels were filled to
overflowing with the nomadic laborers. Opaco stood<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
about open-mouthed and watched. It was as good
as a circus come to town. And the outfit—the
Mangan-Hatton Construction Company, from Texas—was
the first of many to arrive. Others came
from Utah, Colorado, and Washington—and it was
rumored that eventually the biggest of them all
would come from Minneapolis—the main contract
company, Demarest, Spruce &amp; Tillou, a concern
that handled millions.</p>

<p>Furthermore, every train that came into Opaco
brought tramps and tramps and tramps. Some of
them were shipped in; others just came. For the
first time Opaco learned that tramps really hunt
for work; because all that arrived went shambling
to the temporary office which Mr. Hunter Mangan
had set up, and came away examining meal tickets
and speculating with one another on the job-to-be,
somewhere out there in the land of the horned toad
and the venomous sidewinder, and the little desert
owl called <i>tecolote</i>.</p>

<p>A long-bearded man on a magnificent black horse
rode into Opaco, with jingling silver spurs, flapping
chaps, and brush-scarred tapaderos. The rider
“packed a six,” and rode in an elaborate silver-mounted
saddle. The West was written all over
him.</p>

<p>“There’s Squawtooth Canby,” Opaco whispered
to itself. “He ain’t been in town for three months
or more. Say, I guess he should worry, eh? Railroad<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
buildin’ right through Squawtooth Ranch!
Where he had to drive his cows from ninety to a
hundred an’ fifty miles to ship ’em, and run all
the fat off ’em, he’ll shoot ’em in the cars right
on his own ranch when the railroad’s built. It’ll
make a millionaire out o’ Squawtooth Canby!”</p>

<p>The old man with the flowing gray beard rode
direct to the City Hotel, and dismounted as gracefully
as a youth of twenty-one. He lowered the
plaited, tasseled reins from the black’s neck, and,
with the beautiful animal biting at him playfully,
stalked into the hotel, spur rowels whirring.</p>

<p>Half of the hotel office had been given over to
the needs of Mr. Hunter Mangan, senior partner
of the construction company of Mangan &amp; Hatton,
and toward this part Squawtooth Canby strode. A
dark, good-looking, businesslike young man arose
from a desk and held out a cordial hand to the
cowman.</p>

<p>“Well, well, Mr. Canby, it’s good to see you
again,” was “Hunt” Mangan’s greeting. “This is
an unexpected pleasure. We got in only two
nights ago, and I have been so busy since that I
neglected dropping you a line to notify you that
we are on our way. Sit down; sit down! How’s
everything out at Squawtooth?”</p>

<p>Their hands gripped—strong hands, both of them—the
hands of men who rule and are not afraid
of work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>“I heard ye was in, Mr. Mangan,” said Squawtooth.
“I hadta ride in on a matter o’ business
to within fifteen mile of Opaco; so I just says to
myself I’ll fog it on down and shake hands with
Mangan while I’m about it. This town looks like
a gold rush was on.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we’re a tiny concern compared with some
you’ll see before the job’s completed,” Mangan replied.
“But how is the ranch?—and—and Miss
Canby?”</p>

<p>“Oh, ranch is there yet,” and Squawtooth grinned
through his patriarchal beard. “And Manzanita’s
flip as ever. Gettin’ purtier every day, by golly!
Don’t know where she’ll stop. She was talkin’
about ye only t’other day, and wishin’ ye’d hurry
up an’ move out on the desert.”</p>

<p>“Good! And I assure you we’re anxious enough
to get there, too. But this represents only about
three fourths of our outfit. The rest is coming in
to-morrow from a little clean-up job in Utah. So
we’re waiting for them, and will all move out together.
Let me see—it’s two months since I was
at Squawtooth, isn’t it?” Mangan laughed. “I’ll
never forget the first day when I drove up with the
engineers in the buckboard, and Miss Canby told me
what she thought of railroads and railroad builders.
At first, you know, she didn’t realize that I was
one of the contractors who were coming to desecrate
her beloved desert. Did she tell you about it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>“Oh, yes. She told the world about it. Manzanita’s
funny that way. She was born at Squawtooth—in
a saddle, she says—and she don’t like
any other place on earth. She don’t like railroads
ner autos ner flyin’ machines, ner any o’ the modern
tricks. And she don’t like neighbors, either. Just
wants to ride and ride forever over the desert, and
the furder she c’n look without seein’ anything but
what the Almighty put there the better she likes it.
And as for your railroad runnin’ right through
Squawtooth—say, she was wild as a loco Indian.
But she’s calmed down now. She took a likin’
to ye, Mr. Mangan, and I guess that’s what made
her change her mind.”</p>

<p>“I’m certainly glad to hear you say that last,
Mr. Canby.” Hunt Mangan’s face was a little red.
“I—I formed a high opinion of your daughter
during the few days in which you folks at Squawtooth
showed us such royal hospitality. I hated
to have her so sore at me for being a party to the
desecration of her adored solitudes. I consider her
a remarkable young woman.”</p>

<p>“She’s worse than that!” Squawtooth replied, with
a slight frown of abstraction.</p>

<p>Outside, across the street, a freight train stopped
before the depot. Cautiously the door of a box
car slid open, and two hobos looked out, and up and
down the track, then dropped to the ground and
hurried away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>Squawtooth Canby, who had observed through
the fly-specked hotel window, chuckled.</p>

<p>“See them tramps get outa that box car?” he
asked Mangan. “Purty slick, some o’ them fellas.”</p>

<p>“Stay here a day and you’ll see hundreds of
them,” laughingly replied Hunt Mangan. “They’re
drifting in by dozens and twenties. The train crews
are not hard on them, for they know they’re beating
it in here to work. Tramps—stiffs, as we call
’em—form the backbone of railroad construction,
you know.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know tramps worked at all,” said Canby.</p>

<p>“You’ll know more about them before the steel
is laid across Squawtooth,” observed Mangan.
“There are tramps and tramps.”</p>

<p>“Here comes them two into the hotel,” remarked
the cowman.</p>

<p>“They’re coming to see me about jobs, no doubt.
Well, they’ve struck the right place. If they’re old-timers
I can use them. But I hate to break new
men in. And there’s little need to just now—there
are plenty of stiffs all up and down the line.”</p>

<p>He swiveled toward the two, who had entered
and now approached the desk.</p>

<p>“Well, fellows,” he said lightly, “what’s the good
word from up the line?”</p>

<p>“Hello, Mr. Mangan,” returned one of the tramps,
speaking out of the corner of his mouth and grinning
good-humoredly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>Mangan rose to his feet “Well, if it isn’t Halfaman
Daisy!” he ejaculated, and strode around Canby
to grip the hobo’s hand. “Tickled to death to see
you, old-timer! Where did you blow from?”</p>

<p>“Aw, I was over in Nebrasky with a little gypo
outfit,” Halfaman said bashfully. “I heard some
o’ the gaycats talkin’ about the Gold Belt Cut-off,
out here in Cal, and when they slipped it that you
folks had a piece of ’er I hit the blinds straight
out. How’s chances, Mr. Mangan?”</p>

<p>“Best in the world, old-timer—best in the world,”
Hunt Mangan assured him. “I’d fire a man to put
you behind one of our teams. Let’s see—you drove
Jack and Ned on snap down on that little Arkansas
job last time you were with us, eh?”</p>

<p>“That’s right, Mr. Mangan.”</p>

<p>“Well, by George, you can have a snap team
on this job, if you want it! I’ve got three big
white Percherons just breaking into snap work.
Under five years old, all three of ’em. Want to
take a shot?”</p>

<p>“Sure do, bossman. She listens good to me.
When you say a horse is a horse he’s a horse.
But say, Mr. Mangan, I—I got a pal that wants
a job, too.”</p>

<p>“This man here?”</p>

<p>“Yes, bossman. And take it from me, he’s one
good scout.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>“Good skinner, did you say?” queried Hunter
Mangan.</p>

<p>“Well—I said ‘good scout;’ but I’ll bet he’s a
good skinner, too. If he ain’t, I’ll make him one.”</p>

<p>“I’ll say he’d have a good instructor, Halfaman.
But you know me. I’m a crank about good men.
I pay well and I feed the best, and I treat a man
white from the word go. Therefore I expect—and
always get—the best stiffs on the line. So if
your side kick is there, he’s on.”</p>

<p>Both Mangan and Canby had been keenly watching
the man who accompanied Halfaman Daisy.
While he was strong and well-built and bronzed,
and had a fearless but kindly eye, he looked anything
but a railroad stiff.</p>

<p>“Well, Mr. Mangan,” Halfaman was saying, “he’s
an educated plug, this Ike; and I’ll bet he could
do lots o’ things better’n chasin’ Jack an’ Ned.”</p>

<p>“That may be true, but it happens that we don’t
need anything but skinners. Let him speak for
himself, Halfaman. Step out here, old-timer. Can
you knock Jack and Ned in the collar to suit the
worst crank in the business?”</p>

<p>The prospective teamster smiled. “I can’t truthfully
say that I’m an expert skinner,” he admitted.
Halfaman, greatly disturbed, was nudging him with
an elbow. “I’ve had quite a little to do with horses
and mules, but I can’t say that I can handle them
as I’ve seen some men do it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>“Uh-huh. Well, that’s a frank confession, anyway.
Most men don’t admit their shortcomings so
readily when applying for a job. Well, I’m sorry—but
we’ve got a fine lot of railroad stock—all young—and
I hate to risk ruining them by breaking in
new men on them. It doesn’t take long for a green
skinner to put the fixings to a young team—you
know that, Halfaman. Sorry, old-timer, but——”</p>

<p>“Now, looky here, Mr. Mangan,” put in Halfaman.
“You ’n’ me’s good friends. This Jasper is
me pal; and if he can’t get on with me, stuff’s off.
Now you c’n give um somethin’ to do, I know.
Come on, Mr. Mangan.”</p>

<p>“You old beggar!” Mangan laughed; then he
wrinkled his brow. “Wait a minute,” he said. “I’ve
just thought of something.”</p>

<p>He went to the old-fashioned telephone back of
the hotel counter and whirled the crank in a signal
ring. Presently he spoke to somebody, then returned
and said:</p>

<p>“I’ve got a job for your pal, Halfaman. The
cooks can use another flunky. If he wants to tackle
that, at thirty-five and, he’s got a job.”</p>

<p>Halfaman looked inquiringly at his friend.</p>

<p>“I’ll try anything once,” said the other.</p>

<p>“You’ve both got jobs, then,” Hunter Mangan
concluded, turning briskly to his desk. “Let’s see—what’s
that impossible name of yours, Halfaman?”</p>

<p>“Rub it in!” grinned the new snap driver. “Make<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
me spill it before everybody! You know it’s
Phinehas.”</p>

<p>Hunter Mangan, in high good nature, chuckled
and wrote the name.</p>

<p>“And yours?” He turned to the other.</p>

<p>“I call myself The Falcon,” came the quiet reply.</p>

<p>“Moniker, eh? But I can’t make out checks to
‘The Falcon,’ can I? What does your mother call
you?”</p>

<p>There was a little space of silence. “I don’t use
my right name, Mr. Mangan,” said the tramp.
“Even Halfaman here doesn’t know it yet. He calls
me Falcon.”</p>

<p>Mangan shrugged. “All right,” he said. “I know
stiffs. None of my business. I’ll put it ‘Falcon
the Flunky’—that do?”</p>

<p>“Good enough.”</p>

<p>Hunter Mangan wrote a little, then handed a
card to each man. “Those’ll let you in the dining
room here at the hotel,” he informed them. “I
guess you can do the rest. And now you’d better
get out and help with the loading up.”</p>

<p>Halfaman looked at his card, then at his employer,
then up at the solemn-faced clock on the
dirty wall. To the clock he spoke.</p>

<p>“It’s three o’clock,” he said. “And this rube
dining room will be closed. But I saw a little short-order
joint right around the corner, and—ahem!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>Hunter Mangan reached into his pocket and passed
him a dollar.</p>

<p>“Get out o’ here!” he ordered.</p>

<p>Grinning, Halfaman pocketed the dollar and hastened
out ahead of Falcon the Flunky.</p>

<p>The cattleman had been a silent listener, his blue
eyes growing wider and wider as the conversation
progressed. Now he looked in puzzlement at the
contractor.</p>

<p>“So that’s the way ye treat ’em, eh?” he said
in a tone of wonderment. “That’s kinda funny.
You’re a college man, Mr. Mangan—I thought
ye’d be kinda stuck up with common tramps.”</p>

<p>Mangan laughed heartily. “I see you know nothing
about construction camps, Mr. Canby,” he said.
“We’re one of the biggest democracies on earth, I
guess. Can’t run ’em any other way. The stiff
is as independent as a hog on ice. Get uppish with
him, and you’ll see your mules standing idle in
your corrals. Wait till we get established out
there. You’ll change your mind about the men
you are pleased to call tramps.”</p>

<p>“What’s a ‘flunky?’” asked Squawtooth.</p>

<p>“Cook’s helper—pot-walloper—roustabout waiter—dishwasher.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I see. Falcon the Flunky! Funny! Kind
of a smart-lookin’ Jasper.”</p>

<p>“He’s seen better days,” remarked Mangan briefly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>“D’ye shell out many dollars like that right along?”
was Canby’s next question.</p>

<p>“Hundreds of them—between jobs, like this.”</p>

<p>“Humph! Charge it up to ’em?”</p>

<p>“I should say not!”</p>

<p>“Jest put ’er down on the wrong side o’ the
profit-an’-loss account, eh?”</p>

<p>“No—on the other side. You’ve got to be a
good fellow in the railroad-construction game, Mr.
Canby. It pays in the end.”</p>

<p>“I’ll punch cows,” observed Canby dryly.</p>

<p>The cattleman took his leave of the senior partner
of the Mangan-Hatton Construction Company within
the hour. He was to spend the night at a small
ranch eight miles from Opaco, and ride to Squawtooth
next day. He mounted the black, swung him
around with a slight cant in the saddle, and galloped
out of town, seeing little, thinking deeply.</p>

<p>The brooding mood held him until he had crossed
the river and passed through a rocky defile in a
chain of buttes. Then the yellow desert opened
its arms to him, and he and the black horse became
a moving atom in the vast waste.</p>

<p>He had ridden the fifteen miles of which he
had told Mangan for the sole purpose of seeing
that gentleman for a few minutes once more. He
had met Mangan during the earlier part of the
preliminary survey of the proposed railroad. A
month previous to that meeting two of the main<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
contractors had called at Squawtooth—Messrs. Demarest
and Tillou, of the big firm of Demarest,
Spruce &amp; Tillou, of Minneapolis. It was
Mr. Demarest who had told Squawtooth that Mangan
very likely would decide to subcontract the
piece of work nearest to Squawtooth, and that
they would be neighbors. Demarest had spoken of
the subcontractors as young, energetic men of means,
and Squawtooth had become doubly interested.</p>

<p>Then Hunter Mangan himself had come, and at
once old Squawtooth took a liking to him—not
forgetting that descriptive phrase of Demarest,
“young, energetic men of means.”</p>

<p>For be it known that Webster Canby, more
commonly known as Squawtooth, the cattle king of
the desert country, was an incorrigible snob. Aside
from this he was pretty decent.</p>

<p>Squawtooth Canby’s wife had been dead ten
years. The mistress of Squawtooth Ranch, then,
was his daughter, Miss Manzanita Canby—a thorn
in his flesh, the sting of which he both loved and
deplored.</p>

<p>Manzanita Canby was nineteen; and if Squawtooth
Canby was an incorrigible snob, she was an
incorrigible roughneck. Three years of her young
life had been spent away from Squawtooth while
she was at school in Los Angeles. These three
years had made no appreciable dent in her. She
seemed to care for nothing in life beyond her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
“pa,” her brother Martin, a good saddle and saddle
horse, and the illimitable sweep of desert and
mountains; and on this rock all of her father’s
hopes and ambitions for her had grounded.</p>

<p>She attended country dances and permitted fatuously
grinning cow-punchers to swing her lithe figure
in their arms. Of this her father highly disapproved.
She spoke Mexican Spanish like a native,
but beyond this her interest in the languages
died. She cared nothing for well-to-do and good-looking
young men whom her father coerced out
from the cities under the pretext of a bear hunt in
the mountains or a deer hunt through the foothill
chaparral. To marry her to a man of means—now
that this future was assured along these same lines—was
the consuming ambition of Squawtooth Canby,
an ambition that bade fair to be forever fruitless.</p>

<p>So the old cowman had jumped at the chance of
having a young, energetic man of means—one
Hunter Mangan—camped on Squawtooth Ranch
with his big construction company. Surely this
offered the chance of a lifetime to make his daughter
see the error of her ways. And at the very
beginning Manzanita had voiced her disapproval
of a railroad being built over her beloved desert,
and particularly through her beloved Squawtooth
Ranch, and accordingly was averse to the man who
had a hand in the desecration.</p>

<p>Old Squawtooth left no stone unturned to interest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
Manzanita in Hunter Mangan, and he was
quite certain that to interest the young contractor
in his wild and willful daughter was the least difficult
part of his task.</p>

<p>Squawtooth was considered wealthy. Up at
Piñon, in the chain of mountains that fringed the
desert on the south, was his summer range—many
thousand acres in the National Forest. In the
winter the cows fed over a ninety-mile desert range,
from Little Woman Butte to Squawtooth and beyond.
Thus grass was practically assured for all
seasons of the year, and for all time to come,
unless the railroad should bring a flock of homesteaders
down upon him. But if it did this it
would automatically increase the value of his own
holdings. It also would give him wonderful shipping
facilities, both at Squawtooth and Little Woman
Butte.</p>

<p>Yes, Squawtooth Canby was to become a big
man, and Manzanita Canby must be thrown into
the company of big men, so that she might pick
the biggest of them and marry him. And Hunter
Mangan seemed to be the man.</p>

<p>Everything was planned carefully, but still, as
he rode along, the brow of Squawtooth Canby
was corrugated. He could not shake off the presentiment
that all of his strategic plans might fail
because of the willingness of a slip of a girl called
Manzanita.</p>

<small>THE DESERT</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">“LET’S go!” cried Hunter Mangan, seated in the
saddle, and cupping his lean, strong hands about
his mouth.</p>

<p>At the cry a four-mule team moved off with a
load of tents and took to the road that wound
through Opaco, across the bridge, and through the
rocky defile to the desert. A six-up team of horses
followed with a load of lumber. Teams pulling
strings of six-wheeled scrapers fell in line. Two-mule
teams, four-mule teams, six and eight-mule
teams swung into the impressive procession and
followed. And soon a parade a mile and a half
long was trailing in a cloud of dust through open-mouthed
Opaco.</p>

<p>Midway in the procession Halfaman Daisy draped
himself over a high spring seat and looked indolently
down on the slick backs of six young
mules. A cigarette hung from his lip at the corner
of his sagging good-natured mouth. Halfaman’s
load consisted of ranges and commissary stores,
and just behind him, on a huge bundle of canvas
lay Falcon the Flunky, flat on his back, gazing
serenely up into the dusty desert sky.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>“‘And the children of Amram; Aaron and Moses
and Miriam,’” quoted Halfaman drowsily. “‘The
sons also of Aaron; Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and
Ithamar. Eleazar begat Phinehas’—that’s me—‘Phinehas
begat Abishua.’ Abishua—that’s him!
And I’m huntin’ him down—I’m on my way. I’m
on the trail o’ the ‘Wing o’ the Crow’——</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Oh, I been a-down on-a the gumbo line,</div>
<div class="verse">A-skinnin’ mules when the weather’s fine,</div>

<div class="indent">With the pay day—for me ba-bay!</div>
<div class="verse">With the pay day of that gumbo line!”</div>
</div></div>

<p>As a vocalist there was room for improvement
in Mr. Halfaman Daisy, but he sang the old
skinner’s song with a swing and gusto that entertained
his lolling passenger.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“A-hikin’ through a camp on the ole S. P.,</div>
<div class="verse">A gypo queen she a-throwed a kiss at me!</div>
<div class="verse">The pay was a dollar, and the board cost three,</div>

<p>“How d’ye like that song, ol’-timer?” he drawlingly
asked his friend.</p>

<p>“It’s interpretive, to say the least,” Falcon the
Flunky vouchsafed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>“They’s a hundred and fifteen verses that I remember,”
observed Halfaway, “but I’ll only spring
’em on you two or three at a time. Know what
a gypo queen is?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ve heard of gypo queens, or shanty
queens. A gypo man, or shanty man, as I understand
it, is one who owns a very small, dilapidated
construction outfit, and takes subcontracts in light
work from a bigger subcontractor. His daughter—if
he has a daughter—is usually in camp with him,
and she flirts with the stiffs to keep ’em on the
job, despite the poor grub and poor pay and long
hours. Am I right?”</p>

<p>“Right as a fox,” Halfaman replied. “Say, you
have been about the camps a little, ain’t you? Now,
then—did you get an earful o’ my recent begattin’
remarks—pertickelerly the last, where I says:
‘Eleazar begat Phinehas. Phinehas begat Abishua?’”</p>

<p>“Yes, I heard.”</p>

<p>“And now another question, ol’-timer: You’re
such an old head at the railroadin’ game, did you
ever know anybody named Abishua?”</p>

<p>“I think not.”</p>

<p>“Uh-huh—I guess you’re right. It ain’t known
generally that the bird I’m thinkin’ about is named
Abishua. Only the members of his family and a
few close friends—sounds like a newspaper tellin’
about a weddin’ or a funeral—only them know
he’s got a Bible name like that. But his right<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
front name is Abishua. And don’t forget that
Phinehas begat Abishua. Phinehas—that’s me. And
if I begat Abishua I’m a bigger Jasper than Abishua,
ain’t I? Well, what I say goes. How ’bout it?”</p>

<p>“I am hoping,” remarked The Falcon dryly, “that
if you keep on you you may tell me something.”</p>

<p>“Gi’me time, Jack—gi’me time,” retorted Halfaman.
“Stick yer neck in th’ collar, there, ole
tassel-tail! Gi’me time. So you’ve heard tell of
gypo men and gypo queens, but you never heard
of an Ike called Abishua. Well, then, did you
ever hear of a gypo queen called Wing o’ the
Crow?”</p>

<p>The Falcon turned on his side and looked down
at Halfaman. “Wing o’ the Crow,” he said
thoughtfully. “That’s picturesque. What about
her?”</p>

<p>“Her is right. And Abishua begat Wing o’ the
Crow. Believe me, ole Falcon, that was some
begattin’!”</p>

<p>“Yes—go on.”</p>

<p>“Well, his name’s Jeddo—Abishua Jeddo. He’s
a tall, bony shanty man with only one arm. And
his eyes and his hair are black as a crow. So the
stiffs monikered ’im ‘Jeddo the Crow.’ And what
Jeddo the Crow begat is called Joy. She’s twenty-one
years old, as dark as her dad; and say—you
c’n look at her just as easy!</p>

<p>“Her ma’s dead. The girl was born in her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
dad’s gypo outfit, and she’s a gypo queen. But
not like the rest of ’em. Oh, no! She don’t slip
none of ’em a kiss on the side to keep ’em followin’
Jack and Ned for Jeddo the Crow. No,
no! Get fresh with her, and she’ll bend a pick
handle over your frontispiece. She works in the
cook shack, waits table, washes the dishes, and then
goes out and hitches up a team and moves dirt
till mealtime again. Or she c’n stick pigs”—load
scrapers without wheels, commonly called “slips”—“swing
a drillin’ hammer, skin four-up or six-up
or jerkline—do anything on a railroad grade, by
golly! And purty! Say, am I gettin’ talkative?</p>

<p>“Well, anyway, she’s her dad’s right-hand man.
Bein’ one-armed, he couldn’t run the outfit without
Wing o’ the Crow. And now d’ye savvy where
she gets that moniker! Ole Jeddo the Crow is
shy a wing, but he’s got the girl. So she’s Wing
o’ the Crow to the stiffs. And purty—— But now
I know I’m gettin’ talkative!”</p>

<p>“You’re very entertaining,” admitted Falcon the
Flunky. “But I’m curious to know what brought
Jeddo the Crow and Wing o’ the Crow to your
mind just now.”</p>

<p>“Huh! That’s easy! ‘Phinehas begat Abishua,’
and Abishua gotta do what Phinehas says. An’
ole Phinehas he says: ‘Jeddo the Crow he’s so reckless
with giant powder and things he’s likely to
lose his other wing. And he’d better prepare for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
it by gettin’ another wing in the family beforehand.’
That’s what Jeddo the Crow’s begatter
says.”</p>

<p>“Oh-ho! I think I begin to understand. It
may be that out over the desert there Wing o’ the
Crow is in camp, waiting for her Phinehas.”</p>

<p>“Well, if she ain’t there now she’s gonta be
soon. Say, mule, poke yer neck furder into that,
will you? Gonta be soon, ole Falcon. And Phinehas
crossed four States like a ramblin’ kid to be there,
too.</p>

tells the truth right out like I do, he sure is nuts,
ain’t he? Oh, well, at the worst I’m a ramblin’
kid. Now, I’ll say this is some desert—what,
ol’-timer?”</p>

<p>The Falcon looked and gloried in the sight.</p>

<p>Away to the east appeared a hazy line of irregular
calico buttes. To the south and west the pine-studded
ridges of the mountains rose. Between them,
level as a dance floor and covered sparsely with
yucca palms, bronze greasewood, sage, and innumerable
dry lakes, lay the colorful desert baking in the
sun. Now and then a lone coyote stood staring,
then slunk away mysteriously through the low
growth. <i>Tecolote</i>, the wise-eyed little desert owl,
perched himself on the dirt heap beside his hole
in the ground and scolded at them, brave as a lion.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
Lean jack rabbits hopped away indifferently through
the avenues of the greasewood. Halfaman pointed
ahead with the long whip that he never seemed to
need for another purpose.</p>

<p>“I think we’re makin’ for the saddle in that
range o’ buttes,” he said. “That’s where the ole
road comes through and hits the desert—our old
road, boy. I think Squawtooth Ranch is about in
there. That’s where we’re gonta camp, I hear.
Boy, boy! Pass me that ole water bag. Make
haste or I die! ‘And Phinehas begat Abishua!’”</p>

<p>Higher and higher mounted the yellow dust cloud.
On and on into the mocking desert forged the
wagon train, a long, winding snake whose joints
were men and teams and vehicles—a mere worm
wriggling slowly over a yellow carpet in the banquet
hall of the gods.</p>

<p>Evening on the desert, with the mountains casting
their long shadows athwart the rapidly cooling land.
Three black specks, far apart, but drawing together
slowly at a converging point between them
and the squat adobe house at Squawtooth, with its
sheltering cottonwoods and its oasis of green alfalfa
set like an emerald in a sheet of yellow brass.</p>

<p>The three black specks grow larger and larger—two
galloping horses, the one a pinto, the other a
bay, and a mouse-colored pack burro—the California
chuck wagon. A girl rides the pinto, a boy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
the bay, the burro trotting ahead of the latter. The
boy and girl wave their hands at each other and
gallop on. The ponies neigh greetings; the burro
adds his mournful “Aw-ee-aw!” Two of the specks
now become one. Side by side in the cow pony
trot, Manzanita and Martin Canby ride home together
from a day on the desert, the burro, with
Martin’s camp outfit, trotting ahead.</p>

<p>Manzanita was colored almost as brown as the
stumpy trunk of the beautiful shrub after which her
mother had named her. Her hair was chestnut.
She usually wore it in two girlish braids that
reached to the bottom of her saddle skirts. Her
eyes were hazel. With the possible exception of
the waxen plume of the Spanish bayonet, there was
nothing prettier nor more graceful on the desert;
and the hill-billies and desert rats of the male
persuasion would not have admitted the exception.
One thing certain, the plume of the Spanish bayonet
was far more dignified than its animate beauty
rival. She rode with the ease of an amazon in
her silver-mounted man’s saddle—a prize won at
a rodeo for horsewomanship—and carried a holstered
Colt .38 on a .45 frame for company. She
wore a man’s hat with a rattlesnake band, an olive
drab shirt, fringed leather chaps, and riding boots.</p>

<p>Martin Canby was just a freckle-faced, chapped,
spurred, sombreroed kid of the desert—live as an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
eel, all grins, good nature, and backwardness. He
was three years younger than Manzanita.</p>

<p>“Well, kid, did you find those strays?” asked the
girl.</p>

<p>“Yes—a dozen of ’em. That old breechy bunch
with them calves. They’d wandered down the
mountainside and was makin’ it for Caldron Cañon.
Ask me why? I dunno. No grass down there
like’s up on top. Cows don’t know nothin’.”</p>

<p>“Your speech is artistic, <i>mi hermano</i>. Say ‘Cows
don’t know anything.’”</p>

<p>“‘Cows don’t know anything,’” repeated Mart
dutifully. “Has pa got back from Opaco?”</p>

<p>“<i>Quién sabe!</i> Hadn’t when I left home. I don’t
expect him before to-night.”</p>

<p>“What’d he go for, anyway? Said he wanted
to see ‘Flip’ Globe. What’d he wanta see Flip for?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t the remotest idea, Martie.”</p>

<p>“I have,” Mart declared. “Not what he wanted
to see Flip about, but what took ’im to Opaco.
I met ‘Splicer’ Kurtz this afternoon. He was comin’
down from the mountains for somethin’—I forget
what. Said he heard yer friend Mangan had got
into Opaco with his outfit. If that’s so, pa went to
see Mangan. What’ll ye bet?”</p>

<p>“Nothing. I’m positive he rode in for the sole
purpose of seeing Mr. Mangan and that the Flip
Globe story was—well, just a story.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>“Pa Squawtooth sure took to that Mangan, didn’t
he, Nita?”</p>

<p>“<i>Si, señor. Yo penso.</i>”</p>

<p>“And I know why! I know why!” Mart sang
boyishly, wrinkling his snubbed and peeling nose at
his sister.</p>

<p>“Oh, you do! Well, let me tell you something,
old kid—he’s on a wild-goose chase. This Hunter
Mangan seems to be a pretty square sort of a fellow.
But that ends it so far as I’m concerned. Between
you and me, podhead, I don’t dislike Mr. Mangan
nearly so much as I pretended I do to Pa Squawtooth.
That is, personally, you understand. But
I do detest what he represents—the railroad through
Squawtooth. I don’t want it there; and if I had
my way it would never be there. Pa Squawtooth,
old money snob that he is, thinks it the finest thing
on earth, of course. It’s a wonder he didn’t try
to have it through the front yard, with a depot
before the door! It’ll ruin my desert—that’s what
it’ll do! Soon folks will be moving in and taking
up land, and—oh, dear!—it makes me sick to think
of it!”</p>

<p>“Aw, what d’you care? We’ll have lots fun
when the camps get here.”</p>

<p>“You will, maybe, but I won’t. And furthermore,
Mr. Wiseman Pod, you don’t know whether even
you will have fun, as you so youthfully express it.
What do you know about camps like that? You<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
know nothing of the world that you haven’t seen
between a cow’s horns, <i>muchacho</i>. Maybe you’ll
have fun, and maybe you won’t.”</p>

<p>Mart grasped his saddle horn and leaned toward
the ground, hooking the counter of one of his
high-heeled cowboy boots about the cantle. Mart
had been still entirely too long. With ease he
grasped a bunch of the plant called squawtooth,
which gave the district its name, and five spears of
which, shaped like the ribs of a fan, was the Squawtooth
brand. Mart held on for dear life while his
pony polled. The slender, fluted, rushlike spears
were tough and held tenaciously; and next instant
Mart was unhorsed and standing on his head in the
sand.</p>

<p>His sister shouted with derisive laughter. “You’re
a goose!” she cried. “Watch me!”</p>

<p>Leaning low in the saddle, she set her mare
at a gallop toward a bunch of squawtooth that
upreared itself from a bed of fine desert sand. As
the pinto neared it Manzanita swung toward the
earth, hooked a heel about her cantle, and grasped
the plant as the mare sped by.</p>

<p>This was an old game of the two. The squawtooth
was tenacious; sometimes they were able to
snap it off, sometimes otherwise. If not, and they
refused to loose their hold——</p>

<p>Well, in this instance, too, there was a flutter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
of leather chaps, a girl spinning head down in air,
and a smothered plup in the sand bed.</p>

<p>A hundred yards apart brother and sister sat on
the ground and watched their horses and the burro,
the latter with his shaggy head down and playfully
kicking to right and left, racing off toward
home without them.</p>

<p>“Le’s walk!” shouted Mart. “Darn that burro!
There goes my fryin’ pan!”</p>

<p>The girl brushed the sand from her hair and
ears and eyebrows.</p>

<p>“All right!” she sputtered. “And there goes your
bacon, too! And that last looked like a loaf of
bread. As I was saying,” she continued serenely
when he came up to her, “you know nothing whatever
about railroad-construction camps. Neither
do I, and I’m content in my ignorance. I know
just what pa means to do. He’ll invite Mr. Mangan
and any of the rest of the bosses that he thinks
are big bugs to the house; and he’ll do everything
in his power to make me interested in one of them—Mangan,
of course, since he’s supposed to be the
wealthiest of all of them. Oh, he makes me sick!
Say—wait a minute; my boot’s full of sand.”</p>

<p>She sat down, removed her elaborately stitched
tampico-top riding boot, shook the sand from it,
and dusted her stocking. Mart waited, chewing
absently on a spear of squawtooth. Mart had been
told by the Indians that to chew squawtooth was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
good for kidney trouble. Mart did not know that
he had kidney trouble, and he did not like the
bitter taste of squawtooth. But considering that
an ounce of prevention is better than a pound of
cure, he chewed it all day long when riding the
desert and mountains after cows.</p>

<p>“There! That feels better.”</p>

<p>Manzanita had slipped her boot on again and removed
her silver spurs. Side by side they plodded
on through the clinging sand.</p>

<p>“Darn them <i>caballos</i>!” muttered Mart.</p>

<p>“You should say, ‘Darn those <i>caballos</i>,’ brother
mine.”</p>

<p>“‘Darn those <i>caballos</i>,’” seriously repeated Mart,
chewing his squawtooth and stooping to recover
his frying pan.</p>

<p>“But I’ll fix Pa Squawtooth,” Manzanita went
on. “I’ve got it all planned out. He can’t sell me
like one of his beef stock to any moneyed man.
I’m going to revolt.”</p>

<p>“What d’ye mean revolt?”</p>

<p>“Can you keep your young face closed?”</p>

<p>“Uh-huh.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, I’m going to make monkeys out of
Pa Squawtooth and any one who contemplates aiding
and abetting him in the crime of making a
lady out of me. I’m going to pretend to fall right
in with the big scheme of getting friendly with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
men in the camps. I’m going to pick me a railroader
and make up to him. Listen, kid brother—I’m
going to pick out the least prominent person
in the whole shooting match—the man who gets the
lowest pay of all of them, the scum of the camps.
And I’ll at least give him the time of his young
life. Say, won’t they be sick, podhead! Try to
make a monkey out of me! We’ll see who’s a
monkey by the time I’m through. Mart, I’m going
to be a regular little devil! You watch!”</p>

<p>“That’ll be fun,” Mart observed sagely. “Who
you gonta make out like you’re stuck on, Nita?
Say, that was my side o’ bacon! Here she is half
covered with sand. That ole skate o’ yours stepped
on her!”</p>

<p>“It’s all right. Dust it off, and it’ll be good
as ever. Sand’s good for your craw. It’s a wonder
you wouldn’t learn how to throw a diamond
hitch on a pack, Mart. But listen: Mr. Mangan
told me all about the camps, and the different kinds
of work the men do. I’m going to make friends
with the man who wallops the pots in the Mangan-Hatton
cook tent. I don’t care who he is or what
he’s like. Pa says I’m a roughneck, and I’ll at
least show him he’s right about that. I’m going
to get stuck—as you so vulgarly put it—on the
helper of Mangan’s cook. They call him a flunky,
Mr. Mangan said. Now you keep that under your
hat, will you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>“Sure,” Mart promised, still taking his kidney
treatment.</p>

<p>Then suddenly he stopped in his tracks and
pointed across the darkening desert toward Opaco.
“What’s that big dust cloud?” he wondered. “Can’t
be a whirlwind—she’s too big. Say, Nita! That’s
Mangan’s outfit a-comin’. What’ll ye bet?”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV<br>

<small>CAMPED</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">NIGHT had cast its black poncho over the desert
when the Mangan-Hatton outfit completed its
ninety-mile journey from Opaco. Up close to the
chain of calico buttes that upreared from the level
land as if a giant child had piled them there in
play, the wagon train was halted.</p>

<p>It was two hours beyond their regular feeding
time, and the disappointed mules brayed ceaselessly.
One minute’s delay in this important matter is sufficient
to cause a railroad mule to tell the world
about it, and two hours of infraction of the rules
brought forth a protest proportionately heartrending.
The vehicles were drawn up in a hollow square,
and teams were unharnessed and fed inside the
barrier, which served as a corral. There was
necessarily a great hubbub, for there was no moon
and nobody seemed to know where anything was.
Orders were bawled right and left, amended, countermanded,
and disregarded. Men swore intermittently,
especially when they came in contact with
a nest of desert cacti, unseen in the dark, but quite
able to make its presence known. Teams stamped
and eagerly crunched their feed. Men fell over piles
of harness and kicked things—sometimes to their
regret.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>A calmer crew presided over a range set up
temporarily in the sand. Here was little confusion,
for all had seen to it that the cooks and their
flunkies were supplied with provisions and the
necessary tools.</p>

<p>Falcon the Flunky was greatly in evidence, slicing
loaf after loaf of baker’s bread by the flickering
light of gasoline torches, cutting ham into what he
tried to convince himself were thin slices, carrying
bucket after bucket of water from the tank wagon,
conveniently backed up to the scene of these culinary
activities, and staking the range with greasewood
roots foraged from the desert which had heaved
them up. It is said of the desert that there one
digs his wood and climbs for his water; which is
quite true, since the roots of the greasewood make
better fuel than the branches, and springs are invariably
in the foothills, on higher land.</p>

<p>Already Falcon the Flunky was becoming familiar
with his task. The outfit had camped several times
since leaving Opaco, and he had learned much.</p>

<p>The head cook—or chef, as he is dignified by
the stiffs—was an old-time camp cook, and one
of the best in railroad-construction circles. “Lardo
the Cook” was a hard worker and a whirlwind for
speed—tall, bony-faced, and paste-skinned—and, furthermore,
he was a good fellow. There was a second
cook called “Baldy,” and two more flunkies
called “Rambo the Bouncer” and “Strip.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>Not long after the stock had been fed and
watered Falcon the Flunky, at Lardo’s command,
beat upon a dishpan with his knuckles and shouted:
“Come get it!” And like a pack of hungry wolves
the strangers on the desert swooped down upon
ham and eggs and cottage-fried potatoes, for the
unaccustomed coldness of the desert night and the
delay had made them ravenous.</p>

<p>They sat on the ground about the range and
held plates and coffee cups, while Falcon the Flunky
and the other two piled victuals in the plates and
poured steaming coffee in the cups. Over the range
the cooks worked speedily, frying more and more
and more.</p>

<p>Hunter Mangan, with his walking boss and his
bookkeeper, sat with the rest on the ground and
ate as greedily as anybody. Mangan’s eyes followed
Falcon the Flunky as he hustled about supplying
the hungry men, always ready, always willing,
silent when asking some one if he wanted anything
more, patiently efficient.</p>

<p>“That’s quite a flunky you’ve got, Hunt,” remarked
the walking boss, a big, fat, red-faced
giant named Reynolds. “Now, that’s the way I
like to see a man act. He savvies that these stiffs
are half starved and that most of ’em have been
drivin’ teams all day, while he’s been only ridin’
and lookin’ at the scenery. He can’t do enough for
’em. Where’d that bird blow from?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>“He blew into Opaco with Halfaman Daisy,”
replied Hunt Mangan. “That’s all I know about
him—except that he’s not a stiff.”</p>

<p>Reynolds chuckled in his fat, rollicking way and
held out his coffee cup toward Falcon the Flunky,
who reached him promptly with his big copper
coffeepot.</p>

<p>“What else, now?” asked the flunky, when the
coffee was poured. “Better have another egg. No?
And how about you, Mr. Mangan?”</p>

<p>“That ain’t so bad,” observed Reynolds, “and
he ain’t handshakin’ either. He says the same
thing to the stiffs. I like the feller’s face, Hunt.
He savvies a lot, that bird.”</p>

<p>“I’ve got my eye on him,” Hunt Mangan said;
“I like to see a man put his heart into what he
doesn’t consider a very good job. That’s the boy
I’m going to watch. Mangan &amp; Hatton can usually
find a place for men like that.”</p>

<p>“I’ll say so,” Steve agreed. “Where’d Halfaman
blow from, did he say?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I was talking with him last night. He’s
been over in Nebraska on the G. &amp; N. M. job. Said
he heard we were going to have a piece out here,
and he hit the road west. He thinks I swallowed
it, I suppose. Why should he leave the G. &amp; N. M.
job to come out here? There are some good old
contractors on that job, and he knows all of them
and can get about what he wants there. But he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
blew, and beat it all the way out here for the love
of Mangan-Hatton. Huh!”</p>

<p>“Then why did he come. Hunt?”</p>

<p>“Remember when he was with us on the T. P.
in Texas?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“And remember who was subbing off us on the
south—camped right next to us?”</p>

<p>“Sure—Jeddo the Crow. Oh, I get you now!
Jeddo’ll be on this job soon, hey? And with him
will be Wing o’ the Crow! So that’s the big idea.
You can’t hold Halfaman when Jeddo gets out here.”</p>

<p>“I thought I might if I give him a snap team,”
said Hunt. “Jeddo the Crow will probably camp
right next door to us. Halfaman can have a good
job, and not be a mile away from the girl at that.
I’d like to hold him. He’s a bear with a team.”</p>

<p>“Good man, all right. Popular with the rest o’
the stiffs, too. And that means a lot. How ’bout
that black-haired little kid of Jeddo’s, Hunt? Is
she a regular shanty queen of the old school?”</p>

<p>“No, Steve. She’s mighty pretty, too. And work!
She’s as good as a man. If that fellow Jeddo had
any pep and would cut the booze he’d make good.
But he’s a thorough gypo man—doesn’t care, I
guess. Just loves the life and is content to drag
along with a few old skates and a collection of
junk for tools. But Wing o’ the Crow is different.
She takes after her mother, I suppose. Mrs. Jeddo<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
was a pretty nice little woman, mild and ladylike
and uncomplaining. Say, it wouldn’t be a bad
idea for all concerned if Halfaman could horn in
there. He and that girl would move dirt.”</p>

<p>“Uh-huh,” agreed Steve.</p>

<p>Soon the camp was rolled in blankets after the
meal, and only the flunkies worked under the gasoline
torches. Later they, too, lay on the hard ground,
looking up at the desert stars, speculating on their
future in this wilderness before they dropped asleep.</p>

<p>The mules and horses crunched their alfalfa hay,
or rested their weary bodies in the white sand.
The night wind of the desert blew softly through
the chevaux-de-frise of the yuccas, which moaned
dismally. Over on the summit of a rocky butte
a coyote laughed at his mate, who laughed derisively
back from another eminence. Falcon the Flunky
lay under a wagon, wrapped in a quilt, his head on
his rolled-up coat. If there was a mystery in the
line of Falcon the Flunky it was now in the background
of his mind; for he was dreaming that Lardo
the Cook had ordered him to slice a thousand hams,
with no slice a hair’s breadth thicker than the rest.
The task kept him rather busy.</p>

<p>At six o’clock the following morning Webster
Canby and his brood of five were at breakfast.
Besides Mart and Manzanita, the brood for the
present consisted of “Crip” Richey and “Limpy”
Pardoe—gentlemen of the saddle—and Mrs. Ehrhart,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
the housekeeper. The cows were on summer pasture
at this time of year, up on the mountain meadows,
and the remainder of the vaqueros were with them
at the camp called Piñon—Ed Chazzy, “Lucky” Gilfoyle,
Splicer Kurtz, and “Toddlebike” Todd.
Pardoe and Richey belonged up there, and were
at the home ranch for only twenty-four hours.
Mart Canby, too, belonged up there; but for the
present Mart was interested in the new railroad
camps and had decided, with the consent of a lenient
father, to “get an eyeful” before returning to the
altitudes. Miss Manzanita Canby was always anywhere
she wished to be at any time she wished,
so long as the pinto could get her there in conformance
with these wishes.</p>

<p>“Did you see ’em, Manzy?” Mart asked his sister,
who had just taken her seat at the foot of the
table, for Mrs. Ehrhart occupied the head.</p>

<p>“Yes,” Manzanita replied. “And goodness knows
they all but cover the desert! Did you ever see
so many wagons and horses and mules and things?”</p>

<p>“By the way, Crip,” said Squawtooth to one of
the vaqueros, “you want to have Ed kill a couple
o’ steers and get ’em down to Mr. Mangan by to-night.
I don’t know how often he’ll want beef
after that, and I guess he don’t know himself just
yet. But find out if you can when you deliver this,
and try and not disappoint ’em.”</p>

<p>Manzanita winked at Mart. “That’s right, Pa<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
Squawtooth,” she cut in. “Take care of ’em
the best you know how. We don’t have such
close neighbors often. <i>Muy bueno!</i>”</p>

<p>Squawtooth gravely stroked his long beard and
eyed his beloved daughter speculatively.</p>

<p>“Still sore about us havin’ a railroad?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Us? That’s about right, Pa Squawtooth! Oh,
I don’t know. I guess not. Mart says he and I
are going to have lots of fun at the camps.”</p>

<p>“Oh, is that so! Well, Mr. Mart will be foggin’
it for Piñon when he’s had what fun his dad thinks
is good for him. There’s drift fence needs buildin’
up there, ain’t they, Limpy?”</p>

<p>Limpy could not answer immediately, for Mrs.
Ehrhart’s biscuits were large, and Limpy was of
that school of epicureans who hold that half a
biscuit constitutes a bite, regardless of the biscuit’s
over-all dimensions. But he could nod—and did so,
glancing guiltily at Manzanita, for he knew she was
not of his school. Anyway, her little mouth, which
always looked as if she had just kissed that brilliant
desert flower called Indian paint brush, would
have excluded her from the half-a-biscuit-at-a-bite
cult.</p>

<p>“I don’t like to build drift fence, pa,” Mart told
his father. “Can’t I go on herd when I go back,
and let some one that likes to build drift fence
do it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>By this time Limpy had proved the efficacy of
his school, and was able to remark:</p>

<p>“They ain’t no such animal.”</p>

<p>At which Manzanita laughed—whereupon Limpy
and his dining chair were transported to the edge
of a silver-tipped cloud, which is a giddy perch
indeed.</p>

<p>“What are you going to do to-day, Mart?” asked
the girl.</p>

<p>“Go over to Mangan’s camp, o’ course, and see
the stiffs.”</p>

<p>“What do you know about stiffs, I’d like to
know!”</p>

<p>“I’d like to know what he knows about them
mulies and their calves that drifted down toward
Caldron Cañon,” dryly put in Squawtooth.</p>

<p>“I got ’em,” Mart proclaimed. “I headed ’em
onto the Canterbury grade and drifted ’em up as
far as Shirttail Bend.”</p>

<p>“Wonderful! And they told ye they’d go on back
up to Piñon then, did they?”</p>

<p>“Aw, they will! You know they will, pa. They
always do that.”</p>

<p>“Nice cows, son—dootiful cows. Like my son
and daughter. Well, if they don’t you can throw
the diamond hitch on Mono and get in yer little
saddle and stay out till they do. An’ in the meantime,
I reckon the stiffs can take care of ’emselves.”</p>

<p>“All right! That’s a go. You le’ me stick<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
around here till I see what’s to be seen, an’ if
Crip or Limpy says them cows ain’t back when
they bring down Mangan’s meat, I’ll go shoot ’em
back.”</p>

<p>“I’d say <i>Mr.</i> Mangan, if I was you, son,” complacently
corrected his father.</p>

<p>“Mr. Mangan,” dutifully parroted Mart. He had
learned that to correct himself when corrected by
his so-called betters was to forestall unpleasant
argument.</p>

<p>“When are you going over to the railroad camp,
<i>muchacho</i>?” Mart’s sister wanted to know.</p>

<p>“Just as soon as I eat this biscuit and Mis’
Ehrhart clears her throat like she does when she
thinks everybody’s et enough.”</p>

<p>Everybody laughed at this.</p>

<p>“You little nut!” cried Manzanita, and, throwing
her arms about her wriggling brother, kissed
him on his blistered nose.</p>

<p>Limpy thoughtfully studied his own nose and
no doubt wished that it were blistered. Crip looked
at the bottom of his coffee cup and sighed.</p>

<p>“Well, clear your throat, Mrs. Ehrhart!” cried
the girl. “Everybody’s through. I’m going with
Mart.”</p>

<p>“Who said you was?”</p>

<p>“Were, <i>hermano</i>.”</p>

<p>“<i>Were.</i>”</p>

<p>“<i>I</i> did. Can’t I, pa?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>“Certainly, Nita. Mr. Mangan’ll be more than
glad to have you. He told me as much.”</p>

<p>Limpy decided to kill Mangan on sight, if his
look meant anything.</p>

<p>“Tell Mr. Mangan I’ll be over pretty soon,”
said Squawtooth.</p>

<p>They rose from the table together.</p>

<p>“Now don’t bother Mr. Mangan, Mart,” cautioned
his father.</p>

<p>“Huh! How ’bout Manzanita?” retorted Mart.
Whereupon Manzanita punished him by pinching
his arm.</p>

<p>“Your sister’s older than you, Mart, and she’s
a lady,” said Squawtooth Canby.</p>

<p>“Huh! I don’t want no ladies in mine if she’s
one,” said Mart.</p>

<p>“If I thought you meant that,” said his dad,
“there wouldn’t be enough quirts on the rancho to
last out what I’d do to you. But seein’ you’re a
Canby, I reckon you just slipped a little. Go on
now before the both of you get my goat.”</p>

<p>“Not till I’ve kissed you where your mouth ought
to be!” cried his daughter, parting his heavy mustache
and planting a kiss on his lips.</p>

<p>Then Manzanita and Mart raced from the old
one-story adobe to the stables to saddle up. They
raced in the saddling, mounted, and raced to the
corral gate, and out of the yard to the desert,
where they continued to race over the yellow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
stretches toward the big dirty-white tents that were
rising one by one against the background of the
calico buttes.</p>

<p>Although nineteen and sixteen respectively, these
children of the desert were not so sophisticated as
are young persons of the same age born and reared
in cities, and they acted like sixteen and thirteen,
which they were perhaps in worldly experience.
It seemed to their doting, gray-headed father that
neither ever would grow up. And he did not know
that he wished it to occur too soon, in Mart’s case,
anyway. But Manzanita was growing altogether
too pretty and susceptible to be allowed to dance
with cow-punchers and penniless prospectors much
longer, for Squawtooth knew the way of a man
and a maid, and the girl showed a marked preference
for the chapped and ragged-shirted man of
the plains. She was of age and her own mistress—and
girls married young in the cattle country.</p>

<p>“I’m going to do it to-day, Martie!” came his
sister’s shout on the morning wind. “I’m going
to snub Mangan and make friends with the dirtiest
flunky in the bunch! You watch, old kid!”</p>

<p>“<i>Mr.</i> Mangan!” shrilly corrected Mart from behind,
for his snip-nosed bay was no match for
Manzanita’s pinto mare.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V<br>

<small>VISITORS</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE stock of the Mangan-Hatton Company were
soft from the trip by train from Utah, and
the pull through the desert sand on top of that
had worn them out. Therefore Hunter Mangan
decided to let them rest out their first day in the
new camp, while the men devoted themselves to
making their coming sojourn at the foot of the
buttes as comforting as possible.</p>

<p>Early they went to work and before the two
young Canbys swooped down upon them, the large
dining tent and the cook tent were up, together with
several bunk tents and the commissary, which last
was as big and as round as a good-sized circus
tent. Now the men were at work on the stable
tent—a mere “top” of huge proportions. At their
portable forges the smiths were busy shoeing horses,
sharpening drills, and mending broken implements.
Freighters and axmen had gone to the distant mountains
for piñon pine fir, and mountain mahogany
for fuel, as the desert greasewood supply soon
would prove insufficient for the big camp’s needs.
In the commissary tent the clerks arranged their
stock of goods. In the office tent the bookkeeper,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
his assistant, and the timekeeper fussed with their
appliances and books. In the cook tent and dining
tent the cooks and flunkies worked, setting up the
long oilcloth-covered tables, mending benches broken
by travel, building shelves, and sorting out provisions.</p>

<p>“Look who’s here!” remarked Lardo the Cook
to Falcon the Flunky, as the former came in from
the tank wagon. “Couple o’ Alkali Ikes just made
it in on de Jack-an’-Ned Short Line. A Ike
an’ a Ikerooess. Couple o’ splinters offen sumpin—a
he one an’ a goil. Some Moll, I’ll say—only
she wears leadder pants. Lamp de bot’ of ’em,
Jade. Scenery—no foolin’!”</p>

<p>Falcon the Flunky stepped to the cook-tent door
and saw the new arrivals shaking hands with Hunter
Mangan, fresh and immaculate in neat khaki
and leather puttees.</p>

<p>“Wot about her, ol’-timer? There—wot?”</p>

<p>“She’s certainly pretty,” agreed The Falcon in
his perpetually grave manner. “Brother and sister,
I should say. They seem to be acquainted with
Mangan.”</p>

<p>“Guess dey b’long to dat ranch over dere in
dem cottonwoods an’ jungles—hey? Ain’t dat wot
dey call Squawtoot’?”</p>

<p>“I believe so.”</p>

<p>“An ancient hick wid w’iskers—hey? I seen
um in dat Opacko boig talkin’ to de squeeze.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>“Oh, is that he?” observed The Falcon. “I
believe I saw him, too, when I applied for my
job. Wore silver-mounted spurs and chaps—quite
a picturesque old Westerner.”</p>

<p>“Say, kid, youse sure c’n spill de lingo,” Lardo
commented. “Now if I’d ’a’ been a-tellin’ ’bout
dat ole Ezekiel I’d ’a’ said: ‘An ole mattress robber
wid his pins in leadder stovepipes an’ one geed
lamp.’ Pictur-es-<i>que</i>, was he? I’ll say he was
worse’n dat. But wot about dis jane—give us de
dope on her, Jack! Like’s not she’s dis ole cocklebur’s
dawter.”</p>

<p>“She’s pretty,” repeated The Falcon, his eyes
on the girl.</p>

<p>“Any ole snipe shooter could say dat!” retorted
Lardo the Cook. “I done it meself—easy. Youse’re
a disappointment on dat deal, Jack. Well, I guess
youse’ve contrackted an eyeful, now. I didn’t
tell youse to make a telescope outa yerself. Find
me dose drip pans I was huntin’, and den fasten
yerself to de crank o’ dat meat grinder. We’ll
shoot ’em hash fer dinner, ketch-as-ketch-can, an’ if
dey don’t like it dey c’n tell Lardo de Cook. And
dat’s sudden deat’! I killed more gaycats for
kickin’ about hash dan fer any udder reason, Jack.”</p>

<p>Falcon the Flunky returned to his work, but the
girl that he had seen had aroused his interest. She
was as pretty as the little desert flowers he had
enjoyed so much on the trip across the wastes.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
She looked like a wild-West moving picture actress
as she sat there in her elaborate saddle, chapped
and booted and spurred, talking to Mangan, except
that—well, Falcon the Flunky did not particularly
care for actresses. The girlish freshness of her
appealed to him most.</p>

<p>He hunted for and found the dripping pans,
made sure that the cold meat they had brought along
had not spoiled, and began grinding it into one
of the pans for hash. It requires a great deal of
grinding to make hash for a construction camp,
and Falcon the Flunky was still engaged in turning
the crank three quarters of an hour later when,
at the cook-tent door, he heard Mangan say:</p>

<p>“And this is the cook tent, Miss Canby. Go
right in. Lardo is a wild man, but we’ll watch
him while you’re around.”</p>

<p>The flaps of the tent were pulled aside to frame
a picture of a girl in chaps and boots and Stetson.
Then said the picture, to whoever was outside at
her back:</p>

<p>“Oh, I want to see the flunky first,” said the
girl. “I’ve never seen a flunky.”</p>

<p>She was looking directly at the patient grinder
of cooked beef. And in that instant the grinder
wished fervently that he was anything but a flunky.</p>

<p>Now a boy with wide eyes and a blistered snub
nose joined the picture. It moved forward a step
or two, and Hunter Mangan became a part of its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
composition. He pointed laughingly at the man
who ground meat.</p>

<p>“That is a flunky,” he said.</p>

<p>There came a devilish twinkle into the girl’s
hazel eyes. With quick, rustling strides she left
the doorway and whirled her spur rowels straight
toward the object under discussion. She held out
a strong hand, browned to the color of her chestnut
hair by desert winds.</p>

<p>“How do you do, Mr. Flunky!” she cried, her
eyes as friendly as a baby’s.</p>

<p>Lardo the Cook, Baldy, Strip, and Rambo the
Bouncer were all eyes and ears. Mangan was laughing
a little forcedly. The snub-nosed cow-puncher
was grinning.</p>

<p>Then The Falcon’s hand left the crank of the
food chopper and grasped the girl’s.</p>

<p>“I’m happy to meet you,” he said easily. “I’m
called Falcon the Flunky.”</p>

<p>Almost a giggle came from the Indian paint-brush
lips.</p>

<p>“I’m Manzanita Canby,” the girl exchanged, with
a roguish twinkle in her eyes. “And this is my
brother, Martin—better known as Podhead. It’s
a wonder Mr. Mangan wouldn’t introduce us.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Canby, I’m happy to know you,” Falcon the
Flunky said, offering his hand to the boy and
making a friend for life by calling him mister.
“And Mr. Mangan is excusable, Miss Canby,” he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
continued, smiling easily, “for he doesn’t know
me by any other name than Falcon the Flunky.
It would have seemed awkward to introduce me to
you as that.”</p>

<p>Her hazel eyes grew round. “Is—is that a—— What
is it, Mr. Mangan? A moniker?”</p>

<p>“That’s my moniker,” said Falcon the Flunky.
“You see, most tramps have monikers, and some
of them are quite unique. I called myself The
Falcon; and when Mr. Mangan took me on as a
cook’s helper he labeled me Falcon the Flunky. It’s
alliterative, and not unpicturesque, and suits me to
a T.”</p>

<p>“But I want to know you by your real name!”
she protested.</p>

<p>“Sorry,” he replied, “but I’m not traveling under
my real name just now.”</p>

<p>“And won’t you tell even me? Whisper it?”
There was a pout on her red lips. Miss Manzanita
Canby could be a wretched little flirt when she
wished. Ask Crip or Limpy or Lucky or Ed
or Toddlebike—gentlemen riders of well-known integrity.</p>

<p>“Sorry to seem rude,” The Falcon held out,
“but I must refuse even you.” To whisper into
that little pink ear a secret kept from all others in
the world was a temptation indeed, but the flunky
held to his rule.</p>

<p>“Falcon the Flunky is our mystery man, Miss<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
Canby,” put in Hunter Mangan in tones that showed
he was not quite sure whether he liked the unexpected
situation or not.</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s delightful!” she cried. “I’ve always
wanted to know a mystery man! And now I don’t
want to know your name. If you ever begin to tell
me I’ll stick my fingers in my ears. Because—I’ll
tell you why—I’m going to be a detective and
find out what the mystery is about you!”</p>

<p>“Ha-ha!” and Mangan laughed. “Quite an idea.
And now let’s go back to the commissary tent,
Miss Canby. I’ll show you——”</p>

<p>“No! No! Not yet. Please! I want Falcon the
Flunky to show me around the culinary department
first. You and Mart go see whatever you had in
mind, Mr. Mangan. I want to begin on my solution
of the mystery.”</p>

<p>“But—er—that is, Miss Canby——”</p>

<p>“Go on, please—I’ll be over directly. Mart wants
to see the stable tent, I know. He’s crazy about
horses. I’ll be over soon—really, truly!”</p>

<p>Martin thereupon braced up and took his cue.
“Aw, come on, Mr. Mangan, an’ let ’er alone.
You don’t know ’er like I do. She always gets
whatever she wants.”</p>

<p>“And, Mr. Mangan,” added Manzanita, “please
ask the cook to have somebody else grind the meat,
won’t you? Really, I want to find out about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
Falcon the Flunky. I’ll solve your mystery for
you.”</p>

<p>There was nothing else for the contractor to do
but to comply with this seeming whim of an irresponsible
and adorable girl. He shrugged, glanced
a little shamefacedly at Lardo the Cook in a request
for him to bow as he had bowed and led
the way out ahead of the grinning Martin.</p>

<p>“Now,” said Manzanita Canby, “introduce me to
the cook and everybody. Mr. Mangan’s too stuck
up for me. They call me a roughneck around here.
Anyway, I like to know just folks, and I’m wild
about stiffs.”</p>

<p>“Cu-can youse beat it!” Lardo the Cook whispered
to Baldy, hastily rubbing dough from hands
and bare arms to be ready for the presentation.</p>

<p>When the rest of the cook-tent’s crew had stammeringly
responded to The Falcon’s introduction
of them to Miss Canby, that young person immediately
lost interest in them and the cook tent.</p>

<p>“I want to see the dining tent,” she informed
The Falcon. “Show me that, won’t you?”</p>

<p>The Falcon would, and Lardo the Cook nodded
acquiescence.</p>

<p>The back entrance of the dining tent was only
two steps from the cook tent—the separation making
for coolness in the former. Both entrances were
screened. Falcon the Flunky held the door open<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
for the camp’s guest, and she passed in under the
big top.</p>

<p>“The stiffs eat here,” explained her self-chosen
guide, indicating two long oilcloth-covered tables
that extended the length of the tent. “And that
smaller table over there is for the royal family.”</p>

<p>“What’s that? But let’s go on out in front before
you tell me. Then I want to know—oh, everything
about construction camps and stiffs.”</p>

<p>He led the way between the long tables to the
front entrance, and she passed out into the morning
sunlight.</p>

<p>“Let’s sit down on the ground here by the door,”
she suggested.</p>

<p>“I’ll get a chair——”</p>

<p>“No, I prefer sitting on the ground. I sit in
chairs only at mealtime.”</p>

<p>Accordingly she sat herself down in the desert
sand, and The Falcon sat beside her. The commissary
tent and the stable tent were in plain view,
both fronting them. At the door of the commissary
stood Hunter Mangan and Mart, the latter pretending
that he was enjoying the big cigar that
mated the contractor’s and looking very important
indeed. Mangan looked toward the dining tent, and
then suddenly turned his eyes elsewhere.</p>

<p>“Look at that kid brother of mine smoking that
big cigar!” Manzanita said with a laugh. “If Pa
Squawtooth should see that! I ought to tell on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
him, but I never do. That boy’s a great care to
me.” She sighed pensively. “Well, now, Mr.
Falcon the Flunky, what is the royal family?”</p>

<p>The Falcon was watching her closely. While
she scooped up sand and allowed it to trickle through
her brown fingers, and seemed to be idly intent
on it, she now and then shot a quick glance from
under her long chestnut lashes toward the commissary.
The flunky was nonplused. Quite apparently
she had been little interested in the culinary department.
That she had made him come straight
through to where she could see Mangan and her
brother was as evident. What had she in mind?
Not a sudden interest in Falcon the Flunky and
the mild mystery suggested—of that he was disappointedly
certain. It piqued him a trifle. Somehow
he found that he wanted her to be interested
in him. How old was she—sixteen or twenty-two
or three? The long heavy braids of glimmering
chestnut hair said “sixteen.” Her developed womanly
figure, for all its strength and litheness, proclaimed
that she was in her twenties.</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon. Why, the royal family of
a construction camp consists of the white-collar
brigade—men who don’t work with their hands to
any appreciable degree—together with the women of
the camp, if there are any about. The contractors
and their families, the bosses, the bookkeepers, timekeepers,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
commissary men, and sometimes an engineer’s
party, if one happens to be boarding with a
contractor. In most camps these eat at a separate
table, and in some cases in a separate dining tent—smaller.
That’s the royal family.”</p>

<p>“Snobs, eh?”</p>

<p>“We-ell—perhaps. I don’t know, though. When
you know the camps better you’ll realize that
democracy is pretty prevalent in big construction
work. I don’t exactly think that snobbish. The
stiffs don’t seem to resent it, anyway. And that’s
the test, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“I suppose so. Are you a stiff?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes.”</p>

<p>“You don’t talk out of one corner of your
mouth and say, ‘De bot’ o’ youse togedder.’ Oh,
I think that’s so funny! They’re regular clowns.”</p>

<p>The Falcon cleared his throat. “How old are
you?” he asked bluntly.</p>

<p>“Nineteen,” she readily told him, sifting sand
over her chaps.</p>

<p>“Mum! You’re deceptive. It’s the way you wear
your hair, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“I fall down in the sand so much,” she said, “it’s
easier to keep it out of my hair this way.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t ask out of mere curiosity,” he told her,
chuckling at her confession. “I—well, I hardly
know how to say it, Miss Canby. But if you were
my sister, for instance, I’d warn you not to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
too familiar with the stiffs. Now please don’t be
offended. You see, I realize that you know nothing
about the tramps or near tramps that make up a
construction camp. They’re all right in their way—I’m
not condemning stiffs in general—but some
might misinterpret your democratic manner. You’ve
had lots to do with cow-punchers, I suppose, and
that might prove misleading. There’s hardly the
chivalry among stiffs that you have found in the
cow camps, I imagine.”</p>

<p>“But you’re a stiff!”</p>

<p>“Of course; of course. But there are stiffs and
stiffs—while it might be said that all cow-punchers
are gentlemanly. You must understand that your
cowmen are always in virtually the same environment,
and are not nearly so nomadic as these men.
But perhaps I shouldn’t have spoken as I did—especially
on such short acquaintance. I meant well,
though.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I can take care of myself pretty well. I’ve
always managed to do so. I pack a six usually.”
Her look implied that life had cheated her in never
having offered an opportunity for her to shoot a
villain or two. “Now you mustn’t censure me. I
get enough of that at home. I’m frightfully crude,
I know; but I do hate to be told about it every
day. But don’t apologize. Go on and tell me
about monikers and getting sloued in the hoosegow,
and the main squeeze and gypo camps, and skinners<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
and muckers and dynos and things. Mr. Mangan
told me a lot before ever I’d seen a camp and
fired my imagination. Who’s the main squeeze?”</p>

<p>The Falcon laughed until he caught her peeking
from under her lashes at the stable tent, where
Mangan and the struggling cigar smoker had gone.
Then he stopped laughing suddenly. Was this a
subtle little flirtation? Was Mangan interested in
this girl? Was she trying to make him jealous?
But if so, why had she picked on the recruit flunky
as a pawn in her game? The Falcon was mystified.
Mangan, it seemed, never had even looked toward
the dining tent since the two had come out and sat
down.</p>

<p>“The main squeeze,” he informed her, “is hobo
slang for anybody in high authority. Mr. Mangan
there is the main squeeze about this camp. But
ordinarily when a construction stiff speaks of the
main squeeze he means the head contractor, or main
contractor, as he is more often called.”</p>

<p>“And who is the main squeeze on this road?”</p>

<p>“The main contractors are the firm of Demarest,
Spruce &amp; Tillou, of Minneapolis. They are a large
concern.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ve met Mr. Demarest! I like him. He’s
my kind—bluff, rough-and-ready, and cross and
kind at the same time. He pulled my queues and
kidded me something fierce, and said if I was his
daughter he’d spank me. Pa had just caught Mart<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
and me smoking corn-silk cigarettes behind the
stable, you know. But at the same time Mr.
Demarest aided and abetted me in my meanness.
He bet me a dollar I couldn’t jump from one
stack of alfalfa to another that we had on the
ranch then, in three trials. I took him up; and the
first two times I slid off to the ground. But the
third time I stuck, and held there clawing at the
hay for pretty nearly a minute. Then he laughed
like thunder in the mountains and paid up like a
sport, and his face got red with little purple jiggers
all over it, and veins and things. He’s a sport.
But go on—explain about main contractors.”</p>

<p>“Well,” complied The Falcon, “the main contractors
take the entire contract for, say, fifty or
maybe a hundred miles—or sometimes maybe for the
entire work—if they’re big enough to swing it.
Then they sublet portions to smaller contractors
for a smaller figure per yard than they have agreed
upon with the company.</p>

<p>“For instance, there’ll be rock work here on
Mangan &amp; Hatton’s piece. There’ll be a deep cut
through the saddle of those two big buttes. The
main contractors probably figured that they could
run that cut and build the accompanying fill for,
say, seventy cents a yard. Then they probably
sublet the job to the Mangan-Hatton Company for
sixty-five cents.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>“Dirt work pays far less per yard, according
to the nature of it.</p>

<p>“Now, after contracting, the main squeeze will
sublet every mile that he can to smaller men. Then
the parts that no one wants to tackle, perhaps because
of the inadequacy of the outfits on the job,
must be attended to by the main contractors themselves.
Naturally to them are left the roughest,
most difficult pieces of the work. They usually
move in last, then, and not only do their own work
but keep a weather eye on what the subs are doing.”</p>

<p>“And Demarest, Spruce &amp; Tillou are to come
here later on?”</p>

<p>“Very likely—unless they sublet all of it. And
there will be dozens of other outfits, large and
small, and ragtowns and——”</p>

<p>“What’s a ragtown?”</p>

<p>“Well, the less you know about a ragtown the
better. They’re tent towns that move around with
big construction work—composed of saloons, dance
halls, gambling games, and such things designed to
get the stiff’s money away from them.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I want to see a ragtown! I was in a saloon
once. There was one up at the gold mine near our
mountain ranch. I put my foot on the rail and
bought drinks for the house. But I drank red
pop. Beer’s bitter. And I can shoot craps, too.
Listen: The kid and I were shooting craps back
of a stable one day, and I threw seven or ’leven<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
six times straight; and I’d just won his neckerchief
and clasp and one of his spurs when old Pa
Squawtooth came snooping around a haystack and
nailed us. That is, he got the kid. I beat it!
When will a ragtown come, do you think?”</p>

<p>“I think I’ll have a word with your father when
one does come,” he told her.</p>

<p>“No, don’t! I won’t get hurt or do anything
wicked. Pa’ll spoil everything. He wants me to
sit around the house all day and play the piano
and crochet. Then, besides, the kid will be sticking
his peeled nose into things, and I’ll have to go
along to take care of him. Now you aren’t going
to lecture any more, are you? What’s a gypo
camp—and a gypo queen?”</p>

<p>Falcon the Flunky had started to tell her when
from the dining-room door behind him he heard
a fervent “Good night!” in familiar tones. Turning,
he saw the drooping mouth and flaring pitcher-handle
ears of Halfaman Daisy, who apparently
had been seeking him.</p>

<p>“Come here, Halfaman,” he ordered. “I want
to introduce you to Miss Canby. She wants to
know about gypo queens, and you’re an authority
on that subject.”</p>

<p>Halfaman’s freckled face went red to the ears,
and he winked with one eye and then the other
at his partner, pleading to be released.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>“Miss Canby,” The Falcon went on, “this is my
partner, Halfaman Daisy.”</p>

<p>The girl was holding out her ready hand, and
Halfaman wriggled toward her and covered it with
his own, removing his cap and promptly dropping
it—stooping for it, stubbing his toe on a greasewood
root buried in the sand, making a spectacle
of himself, and realizing it painfully.</p>

<p>“Ma’am,” he said, straightening at last, “how’s
each paltry division this mornin’? Please’ ta meet
you, ma’am.” Then he stood as if he had been
ordered to be shot at sunrise.</p>

<p>“Are you a stiff, Mr. Halfaman?” the girl asked,
ingenuously.</p>

<p>“Oh, sure—worse’n that.”</p>

<p>“‘Halfaman’ sounds like a puncher name,” she
informed him. “You look like all man to me.
Why do they call you that?”</p>

<p>“Well, you see, ma’am, I’m one o’ the begatters.
I’m Phinehas; and Phinehas begat Abishua. First
Chronicles, sixth chapter—that’s where the begatters
are. Now, you couldn’t call a bird Phinehas and
look pleasant, could you, ma’am? So my old
pardner, his name was Holman, and the stiffs they
got to callin’ me Halfaman just for a kid.”</p>

<p>“Tell Miss Canby about the begatters, Halfaman,”
suggested The Falcon. “Perhaps she doesn’t understand.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>With a look of seriousness Halfaman scraped
his bedraggled cap to one side of his kinky head.</p>

<p>“Have you ever read the Bible, ma’am?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes—lots. Every night before I go to bed
I read a chapter.”</p>

<p>“That’s right, ma’am—that’s right,” approved Mr.
Daisy. “Now next time you read First Chronicles,
sixth chapter. Then you’ll know all about the
begatters. Here’s the way she runs:</p>

<p>“‘And the children of Amram; Aaron and Moses
and Miriam. The sons of Aaron; Nadab and
Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar. Eleazar begat Phinehas;
Phinehas begat Abishua.’</p>

<p>“Phinehas—that’s me. Phinehas begat Abishua.
Now, ma’am, did you ever hear tell o’ Wing o’
the Crow?”</p>

<p>“No, indeed. Tell me.”</p>

<p>“Well, she’s the daughter of a one-winged gypo
man called Jeddo the Crow. She’s just about your
age—maybe a leetle older—but black, ma’am—black
as tar.”</p>

<p>“Oh! Mercy!”</p>

<p>“Whoa! Not all over! You don’t savvy. Just
her hair and eyes. Well, now, you live over there,
don’t you?”</p>

<p>He pointed over the shimmering desert to the
low adobe ranch house, swimming hazily in a yellow
mirage.</p>

<p>Manzanita nodded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>Halfaman raked his cap to the other side of
his head.</p>

<p>“Well, now, when Wing o’ the Crow gets here
with her dad—that’s Abishua—I want you to meet
her—see? You ’n’ her oughta be good pals. She’s
as pretty as you are—and I’ll tell the world that’s
progressin’ some. So you meets her—see?—and
you two gets nice and acquainted—see?—and then
I wanta slip you an earful o’ somethin’ I got on
my chest. Then all you gotta do, ma’am, is use
your inflooence—see? Get me? Now I gotta beat
it. I’m mendin’ harness. Please’ to meet you,
ma’am!”</p>

<p>And he hurried away, whistling out of one corner
of his mouth.</p>

<p>“Why, what a funny man!” remarked Manzanita
laughingly. “What on earth was he talking about?”</p>

<p>“For a heart,” said The Falcon earnestly, “he
has a big nugget of gold. He was talking about
his sweetheart, Wing o’ the Crow, a shanty queen.
But I’m afraid he didn’t explain very well.”</p>

<p>Falcon the Flunky did, however, and now it
seemed that his listener was more interested. She
looked less frequently toward the various places to
which Mangan betook himself, trailed by Mart and
the cigar, and watched The Falcon’s face.</p>

<p>It was a fine, frank face to watch; and more
and more, as thoughts of her petty little game took
to the background, she realized that here was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
sincere, likable young man with brains that were
anything but sluggish. She liked his eyes and their
steady, brotherly look; she noticed that his hands
were trim and clean and strong. His careful articulation,
effortless though it seemed, told volumes
about his upbringing. She had sought out Falcon
the Flunky to use as a tool in her willful game
of thwarting her scheming father and Hunter Mangan;
and now she realized that she had picked
the wrong man for her purpose. She actually was
going to like the flunky.</p>

<p>This would never do! She despised herself
now. Suppose the flunky had proved to be an
uncouth, uninteresting, ignorant person, and that
she had tried to use him in the furtherance of her
own silly ends! Her confidence in her own desirability
was great, spoiled as she had been by adoring vaqueros.
Would it not have been terrible if
she had caused a poor, unfortunate flunky to fall
in love with her? She blushed for shame at her
unthinking selfishness.</p>

<p>But this man was different He was well knit
and muscular, good to look upon, refined, and mysteriously
interesting. If he wanted to fall in love
with her, he should be perfectly able to take care
of his own interests in such a matter. So if he
wanted to go and fall in love with her—why, he
could just go ahead and do it!</p>

<p>In the midst of these musings Manzanita suddenly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
straightened apprehensively. A familiar figure
had ridden in on a magnificent black horse.
Over near the stable tent a half-smoked cigar
dropped in the sand and was stealthily covered by
a booted foot.</p>

<p>“Goodness!” breathed the girl. “There’s pa. I—I
guess I’d better be going.”</p>

<p>Youth plans and plans, but youth’s actualities are
ofttimes disconcerting—nay, appalling!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI<br>

<small>PREACHMENTS</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">A MONTH passed, and where had been only
yucca palms, sand, and cactus, now stood
many tent cities, and hundreds of toilers worked
incessantly. For a hundred miles on the other side
of the chain of calico buttes one might walk and
pass through several camps a day. On the inner
side of the buttes the situation was the same. There
were four rather large camps on Squawtooth Ranch,
including that of the Mangan-Hatton Company;
but the piece of work allotted to Jeddo the Crow
was still without its camp.</p>

<p>Just beyond the buttes a mushroom town had
sprung into being, where were bars and restaurants
and dance halls and gambling devices. Such towns
usually are named as are the Indian boys—on
the spur of the moment. The first settler in this
one was a saloonman from San Francisco. As he
and his workmen were setting up the tent saloon,
which was to become the nucleus for the town,
a desert twister came along, grabbed the tent by
its four corners, and whirled it round and round
at lightning speed, flattening the men or enveloping
them in numerous whipping folds of canvas and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
snarls of guy ropes. One man looked up from the
bed of cactus into which he had been sent sprawling,
and shouted in pidgin: “Whassa malla? Stling
bloke?” So the town became “Stlingbloke.”</p>

<p>From Stlingbloke’s single street late one afternoon
rode two on horseback, and set their horses’ faces
toward the desert.</p>

<p>“Manzanita,” said Hunt Mangan, “I asked Mart
to ride on ahead of us because I wanted to have
a few words with you. I don’t want you to feel
offended, now. I am quite a little older than you,
and think more of you than perhaps you understand.
For these reasons I am going to risk presumptuousness
and try to show you where you’re
wrong. Girl, you have no business in Stlingbloke.”</p>

<p>“Why not? Mart was with me.”</p>

<p>“A mere slip of a boy,” expostulated Hunt.
“You don’t understand at all, and I consider it my
duty to tell you. That’s a wretched hole. Nothing
but saloons and gambling dens.”</p>

<p>Manzanita looked away from him. “No one
spoke to me. Only one man stared at me—a fellow
with a silk vest and a waxed black mustache. But
I guess he only thought I was a freak. Mart
wanted to go, and I went along to look out for
him. He’s such a kid, that little podhead!”</p>

<p>“Heavens and earth!” the contractor replied.
“And what are you? Now listen here: Would
your father approve of your going to Stlingbloke?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>“He was keen enough for the camps to come,
and for the road to be built, I notice. Stlingbloke’s
a part of it, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“It is—a necessary evil, I suppose. But stay
away from it, Nita. If I’m not too bold what
were you doing there, anyway? I nearly fell from
my saddle when I saw you poking around and peering
through doors.”</p>

<p>“Speaking of dropping from your saddle,” said
the girl, “do you see that bunch of squawtooth ahead
there? Well, lope your old skate at it, and grab
your saddle horn, and lean out, and le’s see if you
can pull it up. Bet I can!”</p>

<p>“I won’t be diverted,” he told her gravely. “Anyway,
I’m not up to you in fancy stunts in the
saddle. What were you up to at Stlingbloke?”</p>

<p>“I wanted to buck roulette,” she confessed. “Mart
said there were roulette wheels there. Ed Chazzy
has got a big picture up in the mountains, all
framed and colored and everything, of a lot of
men playing roulette in a gambling house in Arizona.
It’s a dandy. The gamblers have on green eye-shades,
and there’s one fellow just walks about
with a big cigar in his mouth and his hands behind
his back. The lookout, Ed said he was. And
big, big stacks of chips—all colors. And stiffs and
buckaroos and Mexicanos bucking the game. So
I—Mart said there was roulette at Stlingbloke,
and I wanted to try it just once. So Mart and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
I sneaked off and rode over, but there were so
many men in the places that we both lost our
nerve—and then you came along and bawled us
out!”</p>

<p>“Does your brother drink, Manzanita?”</p>

<p>“About a gallon and a half a day.”</p>

<p>“Wh-what!”</p>

<p>“Milk. He wants to get fat, like a traveling
man he saw in Opaco once. And when we have
boiled beef he eats the marrow, too. Now he
goes to your camp and makes Lardo the Cook
let him dig the marrow out of the beef bones,
because you folks have lots of it. But he’ll never
get fat—he eats too much squawtooth for his kidneys.
It counteracts the milk and marrow.”</p>

<p>A man who thinks it his duty to be serious and
cannot is a pitiable sight. Hunter Mangan was
such.</p>

<p>“So Mart doesn’t drink intoxicants?”</p>

<p>“That little podhead? I should say not! He
likes red pop too well, like I do. We both tasted
beer once. Pa Squawtooth gave it to us. No
more for us—squawtooth is bitter enough. Come
on, now—there’s another bush. Try it once!”</p>

<p>“No, I’m no fancy rider. Something would
crack if I were to lean very far from the saddle.
So you didn’t play roulette?”</p>

<p>“No—we backed out. Mart’s going to make a
roulette wheel out of an old wheelbarrow wheel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
we’ve got. He says he can make a wheel of fortune
out of it, anyway. Did you ever buck a
wheel of fortune, Hunt?”</p>

<p>“I’m not on the confessional carpet to-day,” he
replied evasively. “I guess I’ve been as big a
sucker as the next man in my time, though. Where
do you get such weird ideas, Manzanita?”</p>

<p>“Quién sabe!” She shrugged. “Hearing the boys
talk around cow camps, I guess. I’m going to be
a moving picture actress. I can ride and shoot, and
I’m pretty. How about that last?”</p>

<p>“You are,” he assured her fervently.</p>

<p>“Well, that’s what I want to be. Mart’s going
to be my manager. We were going to run away
several times, but something always prevented us.
In the pictures cowgirls go into saloons and buck
the games and all. I’m a cowgirl; but this country’s
always been so tame. Do you think I have the
screen face?”</p>

<p>Hunter Mangan clenched his big tanned fists.
He knew what kind of a face she had, and he
was trembling to take her in his arms and kiss
every inch of it, from the piquant chin to the
chestnut hair. “Cradle robber!” he growled to
himself; then remembering that this girl was nineteen,
he marveled the more.</p>

<p>“You won’t go to Stlingbloke again, will you?”
he pleaded. “Not with just Martin, anyway. Go<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
with your father or with me, if your curiosity
won’t let you keep away.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I suppose not. Unless Mart persists in
going. Then I’ll have to go for his sake, I suppose.
I like the color of it, though.”</p>

<p>“Humph! It seems that for the manager-to-be
of a moving picture star Mart plays second fiddle
to the managed,” he observed dryly.</p>

<p>“Oh, that would be just a convenient business arrangement,”
she explained. “I’d be the boss, of
course. Stars really are, aren’t they? But I’d
want Mart along—I couldn’t live without the little
nut!—and he’d be my manager—a mere figure-head,
of course.”</p>

<p>Gravity gave way to the inevitable, and Hunter
Mangan was lost.</p>

<p>“And now,” he said finally, “I have a more intimate
matter still that I wish to discuss with you.
I certainly hope I’ll be forgiven. I’m usually pretty
blunt, though. So here I go with my head down
and both eyes shut:</p>

<p>“Why have you courted the friendship of Falcon
the Flunky?”</p>

<p>“Why, I like him,” was the swift reply. “What’s
the matter with The Falcon?”</p>

<p>“I am glad to be able to say that, so far as I
know, there is nothing the matter with him. However,
it strikes me—and all the rest of us, I suppose—as
a strange comradeship.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>“He’s a nice young man—a perfect gentleman.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t the slightest doubt in the world as to
that. And still it’s strange. Were you interested
in him from the first day?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps I was. It’s hard to tell.”</p>

<p>“And you really like him?”</p>

<p>“Immensely.”</p>

<p>“Does your father approve of the friendship?”</p>

<p>“Well, he—he doesn’t know anything about it, I
suspect. I’ve never had occasion to mention Falcon
the Flunky to him, as it were.”</p>

<p>“I think you should have left off that ‘as it
were,’ Manzanita. It leads me to believe that you
purposely have refrained from mentioning him to
Mr. Canby.”</p>

<p>“You’re using some dandy words, Hunt,” she
said admiringly.</p>

<p>“You’re not offended, then?”</p>

<p>“Not in the least, <i>amigo</i>!”</p>

<p>“Have you learned Falcon the Flunky’s name?”</p>

<p>“No, he hasn’t told me; and I haven’t pressed
him to tell what he doesn’t wish to.”</p>

<p>Mangan cleared his throat uncomfortably. “The
stiffs, as we call them, Manzanita, come from every
place,” he said. “Nobody knows anything of their
various pasts, and they’re nobody’s business. There
are many bright, intelligent, capable men in trampdom—far
more than is realized by the general
public. But can’t you see that this fact in itself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
should make you cautious about picking a friend
from among them? Bright, capable men have taken
to tramp life in many cases because polite society
has for some reason ostracized them. They may be
bank defaulters, forgers, or even worse. Surely
your reason will tell you that no educated, refined
man need be a tramp laborer these days; and
that, since he is educated and refined, ambition
can’t be lacking. So, such a man must be a
renegade, a fugitive from justice, an ostracized member
of good society to explain his adherence to the
slip-along life of the construction stiff. Now, I
haven’t said a word against Falcon the Flunky,
have I?”</p>

<p>“No, you haven’t. You wouldn’t. You’re a
gentleman and a good sport.”</p>

<p>“Thank you. Despite your many tomboy pranks,
I always find you so reasonable. There’s just one
thing you need, Manzanita, and that is a little
worldly experience. You must grow up.”</p>

<p>“And yet when I want to buck roulette for
worldly experience you kick!”</p>

<p>“I consider that as hardly necessary to your
education,” he said. “But I’m glad you don’t resent
my effort to be friendly. I’ve told you how matters
stand, or may stand. It’s merely a friendly warning
from an old-timer—for even your father doesn’t
understand our life. And of course, anyway, I
wouldn’t go to him with your case.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>“Of course not, Hunt. You’re all right. But
I like The Falcon now; and I just couldn’t think
bad about anybody I like. It’s a Canby trait.
We imagine that anybody we happen to like must
be all right or we wouldn’t like ’em.”</p>

<p>“It’s a lovable trait, too,” he told her warmly.
“And from your unsophisticated viewpoint, it’s a
pretty practical one. But for general purposes in
the complicated life beyond Squawtooth and the
desert, I don’t know that it will fill the bill.”</p>

<p>“I like to hear you talk. Please go on.”</p>

<p>“Are you serious?”</p>

<p>“Sure, Mike! I wish you’d talk lots to Mart.
He certainly can murder the English language.”</p>

<p>“It’s not my theme, then, that interests you—merely
my stilted words.”</p>

<p>“No, no! Not that. I like to hear people say
pretty things. I read lots of poetry. Did you
ever write poetry, Hunt?”</p>

<p>“You’re bound to make me confess, aren’t you?”
he questioned with a laugh. “I’m through lecturing
now. Think over what I have said.”</p>

<p>“Sure. Thank you very much. And now how
about a bunch of squawtooth?”</p>

<p>“You do it. I like to see you, even though I
realize that it is dangerous.”</p>

<p>“When I miss, I suppose, and wave my feet in
air?”</p>

<p>She touched her mare’s ribs, and guided her toward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
a bunch of squawtooth, leaning low from
the saddle as she neared it. Then the mare raced
past, and she grasped it. And this time it plopped
from the sand, and, with her saddle slipped halfway
to the mare’s belly, she righted it and herself
and waved the plant triumphantly.</p>

<p>Hunter Mangan breathed again.</p>

<p>“You tell Mart you saw me do it!” she cried,
circling back to him. “He won’t take my word in
a thing like this. Oh, look! What’s coming?”</p>

<p>They had neared the road, and now coming along
it they saw a little cavalcade that heretofore had
been hidden by particularly tall greasewood.</p>

<p>In the lead moved a camp wagon, the cover
made of wood, as is a gypsy’s migratory home. Six
lean mules heaved in the collars to pull the chariot
through the heavy sand. Driving them was a
girl, with hair and eyes as black as night. Behind
the camp wagon trailed other teams, hitched
to other wagons and wheeled implements of the
grade.</p>

<p>“Jeddo the Crow at last!” cried Mangan. “You’ve
heard of him, Manzanita—you told me so. That’s
Wing o’ the Crow driving six-up. If it were thirty-six
it would make no difference to her. I must
see them. Let’s ride over.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I want to meet Wing o’ the Crow! I’ve
heard so much about her. Come on—beat you there
ten lengths!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII<br>

<small>WING O’ THE CROW</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">HUNTER MANGAN was the senior member
of the rather large firm of contractors from
which the Jeddos had taken their subjob; so Hunt’s
dignity would not permit a dash with Manzanita
to the moving van. They rode forward, then, at
a sedate walk, and when she saw them coming the
young driver of the van pulled her six disconsolate
mules to a stop.</p>

<p>Mangan lifted his broad-brimmed Stetson.</p>

<p>“Hello, there, Miss Jeddo!” he greeted her. “So
you’re here at last. Pretty tough pull, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>Wing o’ the Crow was a beauty—there was no
denying that. She was twenty-two and strong
and lithe as an Indian girl. On her cheeks was that
mahogany-red coloring so attractive in decided brunettes.
Her skin was smooth and flawless as the
skin of an olive, and her great black eyes, made
darker still by the long, black lashes that shadowed
them, were fascinating. Her masses of black hair
showed no more careful attention than does a wind-blown
straw stack, but it lost no picturesqueness
because of this.</p>

<p>“My stars!” gasped Manzanita under her breath.</p>

<p>Wing o’ the Crow smiled bashfully at Hunter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
Mangan, then her big eyes settled a curious look on
his companion.</p>

<p>“Pa’s back at th’ tail end, Mr. Mangan,” she
said. “How fur ’re we from th’ job?”</p>

<p>“Oh, not more than two miles now. I want you
to meet Miss Canby, Miss Jeddo. She lives at that
adobe house over there in the cottonwoods, where
we get our water. You’ll be camping on the ranch.”</p>

<p>Wing o’ the Crow shyly smiled at Manzanita.</p>

<p>“Well, I guess I’ll have to be movin’ ahead,”
she said.</p>

<p>“Wait,” Manzanita told her. “Hunt, you ride
back and see her father, if you want to. I’m going
to ride in the van, if you’ll lead my mare.”</p>

<p>“Good!” said Hunt. “You two get acquainted.”</p>

<p>Manzanita swung to the ground and handed the
contractor her bridle reins. Then she clambered
up over the hub to the seat beside Wing o’ the
Crow, who divided the seat pad with her.</p>

<p>“Hojup!” she exhorted the mules; and they leaned
to the collars and heaved the wagon into motion
again.</p>

<p>For a little neither girl spoke, and both watched
the mules as if a great deal depended on careful
attention to their efforts in the clinging sand. Both
were men’s women, and knew less about other members
of their own sex than of their opposites.
Neither knew how to begin the conversation.</p>

<p>Manzanita, out of the corners of her eyes, took<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
note of the unlaced, run-over shoes and the negligently
held-up black stockings of Jeddo’s daughter,
also the cheap ring on a workworn finger, and the
unstarched gingham dress, over which had been
slipped a man’s shirt, the tail hanging to her knees.
Wing o’ the Crow observed, when chance offered,
the worn leather chaps, the tampico-top boots, the
flannel shirt, and the big-roweled Mexican spurs
of the daughter of Canby.</p>

<p>Then Manzanita thought of something brilliant.</p>

<p>“How long have you been coming?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Jest from Opaco, or all th’ way?” asked the
black-haired girl.</p>

<p>“Both,” said Manzanita.</p>

<p>“We was more’n a week on the railroad,” replied
Wing o’ the Crow. “An’ three days drivin’ outa
that Opaco. Stock’s wore out, purty near. The
railroad trip always does ’em up.”</p>

<p>“Uh-huh—they don’t get any exercise, do they?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Do you like building railroads?”</p>

<p>“I got to. I don’t know anything else. Sometimes
I think I don’t like it; but I guess I do
most o’ the time, any way you look at it.”</p>

<p>“Your mother’s dead, isn’t she? So is mine. I
was only nine when mine died.”</p>

<p>“I was fifteen,” said Wing o’ the Crow. “How
old are you?”</p>

<p>“Nineteen.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>“I’m twenty-two. Do you ride lots?”</p>

<p>“All the time.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to, but we ain’t got any decent saddle
hoss. Herd cows?”</p>

<p>“Sometimes. Mostly just ride, though. I could
get you a saddle horse, and we could ride together
and have lots of fun. Mart—that’s my kid brother—he’d
be along whenever he’s down from the
mountains. Our cows are all up there in summer.
That’s where Mart is supposed to be, building drift
fence and things. He was keen enough to be with
the cows until the camps came. Now he wants to
hang around them all the time. We could shake
him, though, now and then, if we wanted to be
alone.”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t go with you,” said Jeddo’s daughter.
“I gotta work.”</p>

<p>“All the time?”</p>

<p>“Yep.”</p>

<p>“Does your father make you?”</p>

<p>“Not exactly. I like to, I guess. Pa and me
never have trouble. He’s easy-goin’—too easy-goin’,
some folks say. He’s good to me, though. He’s
only got one arm, and I have to do more’n I would
if he wasn’t like that, I guess. That’s why they
call me Wing o’ the Crow—an’ because I’m black.
But I guess you’ve heard.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes—lots about you. I’ve wanted you to
come. I don’t see many girls out here. I thought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
it would be nice for both of us. I’m sorry you
can’t ride with me. We could go up to Little
Woman Butte, and—oh, everywhere.”</p>

<p>“I wisht I could, but I ain’t got the time. I
got lots an’ lots to do every day.”</p>

<p>“What all?”</p>

<p>“Cookin’ an’ washin’ dishes an’ things like that,
an’ stickin’ pigs or skinnin’ Jack an’ Ned—whatever’s
to be done.”</p>

<p>“What is sticking pigs?”</p>

<p>“Settin’ slips. You know—loadin’ them little
scrapers that ain’t got wheels.”</p>

<p>“Is it hard?”</p>

<p>“Purty. ’Long about three in the afternoon,
anyway. It gets you in the back. Then I kinda
got to run things—especially when pa’s cuckooed.”</p>

<p>“When pa’s what?”</p>

<p>“Cuckooed—drunk. Takes him four days to
get enough, an’ five days to get over his jag. That’s
nine days I gotta be bossman.”</p>

<p>No words came to Manzanita now. Brought
face to face suddenly with a tragedy, so matter-of-factly
introduced into the conversation, she did
not know what to say.</p>

<p>“How long have you been a gypo queen?” she
asked presently, still thinking of that naïve reference
to Jeddo the Crow’s shortcomings.</p>

<p>“Born in a gypo camp.”</p>

<p>“Have you been to school?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>“No. Ma used to teach me, but she died. I
c’n read an’ write an’ figger a little. I’m keen about
learnin’ things. I read a lot when I ain’t too tired.
You see, we’re poor. Somehow we jest about break
even on every job we tackle. Pa’d like me to quit
th’ road an’ go to school somewheres, but him
with his one arm, he couldn’t get along. You been
to school a lot, ain’t you? I know by th’ way
you say ‘ing’ at th’ end o’ words. Do you read
lots?”</p>

<p>“Not so very much,” Manzanita confessed. “I’m
usually pretty busy.”</p>

<p>“Doin’ what?”</p>

<p>“Well—now—riding, mostly.”</p>

<p>Manzanita could not read the message of the
inscrutable black eyes now turned upon her. Somehow,
though, she felt uncomfortable, and hastened
to ask:</p>

<p>“Do you live in this van?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I do. I sleep in here. We back it up to
th’ cook tent. Hejupah, ole Ned! Ain’t this here
sand fierce? Guess I’ll let ’em blow a mite.”</p>

<p>She pulled in gradually on the six lines, and the
mules stood heaving.</p>

<p>“I guess I ought to walk,” observed Manzanita.</p>

<p>“Oh, your weight don’t add nothin’ much. They’ll
be all right when we get outa this sand an’ hit
that dry lake over there. Do you like this country?”</p>

<p>“I love it! Don’t you think it’s pretty?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>“Purty dry an’ purty sandy. How’s Mangan-Hatton
gettin’ on with their job?”</p>

<p>“Why, all right, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“Got a cut an’ a fill in rock, ain’t they?”</p>

<p>“I—I think so.”</p>

<p>“This sand’ll make a mighty poor roadbed. Guess
they’ll be lots o’ borrowin’ for th’ crown.”</p>

<p>“Ye-yes, I should imagine so.”</p>

<p>“Mangan-Hatton got any Holligans in the rock?”</p>

<p>“I—I never noticed any. This is just common
rock, I guess.”</p>

<p>“Common rock! What’s that got to do with
Holligans?”</p>

<p>“I thought perhaps Holligans were fissures of
some sort.”</p>

<p>“No, they ain’t much on fishin’, I guess. Unless
they’re ginnies. Most of ’em are Greeks or
Austrians, though. Mostly Mangan-Hatton works
stiffs. Any ragtowns on th’ job?”</p>

<p>“One—quite close. Stlingbloke, they call it.”</p>

<p>“Purty raw?”</p>

<p>“I—I suppose so.”</p>

<p>“How close to where we’re gonta camp will it
be?”</p>

<p>“About four miles off, I should think.”</p>

<p>“Huh! Jest our luck! They’s always a ragtown
right near us, it seems. An’ poor pa he
jest can’t keep away from booze. An’ when he’s
pifflercated then I gotta keep jumpin’.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>“He isn’t mean to you, is he?” asked Manzanita,
in an awed little voice.</p>

<p>“Oh, no. I wouldn’t stand for that. I’m of
age. He jest can’t do nothin’ but lay ’round an’
groan—so I gotta cook an’ be bossman, too.
He<i>jup</i>ah, Ned! <i>He</i>jup, Jack!”</p>

<p>“It seems that every mule on railroad work is
named either Ned or Jack,” remarked Manzanita,
anxious to change the topic.</p>

<p>“Them’s jest railroad names,” explained Wing
o’ the Crow. “Railroaders always call tassel
tails Ned an’ Jack. D’ye know any o’ th’ stiffs yet?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes—lots of them.”</p>

<p>“Who all’s at Mangan-Hatton’s? Any ole-timers,
did you hear?”</p>

<p>“You bet. I know all the old-timers’ names.
There’s Lardo the Cook and Laflin the Goblin,
Tombstone, Totaljohn, and Demijohn, Gus the Finn,
Bung the B-B—I think that’s just too funny!—Davie
the Child,—and, let’s see—Grimes o’ the
Coffins, Raddle the Swamper, Dippy-Dip, The Parasite,
Lobbygow, Markle, and Spot o’ the Outcasts.
Laflin the Goblin is a strange creature. They say
his name will be put up at the next hobo convention
for king of the tramps. Isn’t that too ridiculous?”</p>

<p>“What d’ye mean, redickilous?”</p>

<p>“Why, tramps having a king.”</p>

<p>Wing o’ the Crow was thoughtful. “I guess<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
maybe it is,” she admitted at length. “I never
thought about it. I know purty near all them
stiffs—knew most of ’em all my life. I wish we
could get stiffs—they work so much better, somehow.
But stiffs won’t stay in a gypo camp long,
if they stop there at all. We get hicks—farmers,
and bindle stiffs. They don’t know no better.”</p>

<p>“Why won’t the stiffs work for you?”</p>

<p>“Well, we can’t feed like th’ big bugs do. An’
we can’t afford to furnish blankets. All our
men are bindle stiffs—not regular stiffs, you know—but
th’ fellas that carry bundles on their backs—their
own beddin’. Then our stock is old and
rundown, an’ stiffs want good stock to work with.
If I was like a gypo queen’s supposed to be I
reckon I’m good lookin’ enough to hold the stiffs.
But I ain’t like that. I wouldn’t kid any man
along to get ’im to stick in our camp. I’m a lady,
if I do skin Jack an’ Ned an’ pull a lot o’ rough
stuff. Did you tell me all th’ stiffs’ names that’s
at Mangan-Hatton’s?”</p>

<p>“There’s—now—Falcon the Flunky.”</p>

<p>“Never heard o’ him. Who’s skinnin’ th’ plow
teams on th’ dirt work?”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe I can tell you that. I haven’t
paid a great deal of attention to the work.”</p>

<p>“Don’t know who’s on snap, either?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I believe I do know one snap skinner. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
was going to tell you his name. Halfaman Daisy.
Know him?”</p>

<p>Again there was silence. Then, “I know ’im,”
said Wing o’ the Crow. “How long’s he been
out here?”</p>

<p>“I think he came with the outfit.”</p>

<p>“Uh-huh—how close to Mangan-Hatton is our
campin’ place?”</p>

<p>“Less than a mile away, I think.”</p>

<p>Silence once more. Then, “Does Halfaman Daisy
go to this ragtown very much?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think so. I’ve been there only once,
though—to-day, for the first time.”</p>

<p>“Have Mangan-Hatton had a pay day?”</p>

<p>“One, I think.”</p>

<p>“Uh-huh. I guess Halfaman’s been to that ragtown
then—what d’ye call it? Stlingbloke? Huh—they’re
all stlingbloke, I’ll say.”</p>

<p>Here a tall, ruggedly handsome man, with coal-black
hair and mustache, and with one shirt sleeve
pinned up, rode past on a mule, with Mangan at
his side. They galloped ahead, Mangan leading
Manzanita’s mare.</p>

<p>“Guess we’re purty near there,” observed Wing
o’ the Crow. “I’ll sleep to-night! Don’t suppose
you know what Mangan-Hatton ’re payin’ th’ snap?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t the remotest idea,” replied Manzanita.</p>

<p>Wing o’ the Crow looked at her curiously.
“Funny!” she said. “That outfit’s been here a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
month, I hear, an’ you don’t know nothin’ about
’em but a few stiffs’ names.”</p>

<p>Manzanita looked uncomfortable, and felt as she
looked. There was a strange tone of accusation
in the large black eyes of the girl of the van. It
caused the girl of the desert to feel inferior—insignificant.</p>

<p>“A bunch o’ dance-hall girls at this Stlingbloke,
I guess—huh?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Manzanita.</p>

<p>“Did you see a girl with very light hair—bleached,
I guess?” questioned the gypo queen.</p>

<p>“I didn’t see her when I was there.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll find out from somebody purty soon,
I s’pose. So the begatter’s drivin’ snap for Mangan-Hatton,
eh? Thinks he’s some skinner, that plug!
All right, pa!”</p>

<p>Ahead of them was the man motioning for the
van to circle around him and Mangan and come to
a stop.</p>

<p>“Home, again!” and Wing o’ the Crow sighed.
“Some home, I’ll say! Nice shady spot under that
flower there! Does this country ever get so hot it
smokes?”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII<br>

<small>A TRADE AND NEW RESOLUTIONS</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IN the “borrow pit” to the left of the long dirt
fill that was slowly creeping across the desert
one Phinehas Daisy was at work with his snap
team. The expert skinners in dirt work drive
either the snap team or the plow team. Halfaman’s
three white Percherons were beauties, willing workers,
and it was a pleasure and an honor to handle
them. To see their great muscles at work when
he had hooked the trio to the pole of a loaded
wheeler, to help out the two mules already pulling
to the limit of their strength, was a pleasing sight.</p>

<p>The long line of wheelers and slips moved through
the borrow pit, were loaded, and traveled on to
the evergrowing fill and the dump—an endless
chain. Mr. Daisy rested while a wheeler team was
working up to the snap with the earth, previously
loosened by the plow, billowing into the pan. During
these brief intervals he was thoughtful. Then nonchalantly
he would swing the heavy eveners by
their chain, hook on to the wheeler pole, and
drawl: “Le’s go!”</p>

<p>Then the five animals, with the three proud
Percherons abreast in the lead, would heave into
their collars and make life hugely enjoyable for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
Mr. Daisy. “High!” would come the yell of the
wheeler holders. The five would stop in their tracks,
and Halfaman would quickly disconnect the snap.
Then, swinging sharply to one side, the mule skinner
with his loaded wheeler would laze away toward
the fill. Behind him another wheeler would be
moving up to the wheeler holders, and again for a
brief interval Halfaman would rest, an elbow on
the expansive rump of one of his whites, and grow
pensive.</p>

<p>From Squawtooth Ranch came a big tank
wagon, drawn by six mules that labored ploddingly
in the desert sand. Demijohn drove the tank-wagon
team. The work was not difficult, but monotonous,
consisting as it did of trip after trip between the pipe
that spouted artesian water at Squawtooth and the
Mangan-Hatton camp. Demijohn was an active man
and loved to be moving about. Furthermore, he was
considered an excellent snap driver, and he cast
a look of envy at Mr. Daisy and his magnificent
three white Percherons. Demijohn was a horse
lover; he merely tolerated mules. Again, six mules
required more “cuffing” and harnessing and collar
scraping than did three horses—a child might figure
that! Also the snap team got through work
fifteen minutes earlier than the other teams, and
at times the water wagon was out so late that the
driver was obliged to eat alone, after everybody
else had finished. And above all, Demijohn was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
human; and what human does not wish that he
had the other fellow’s job and that the other fellow
had his?</p>

<p>Just what was running through Mr. Daisy’s
thoughts which caused him to wish that he were
driving the tank wagon, and that Demijohn had
the snap, would require more space to depict than
in the case of the tank-wagon skinner. But if
the statement he made that the Mangan-Hatton
water wagon was now supplying the comparatively
slight wants of the tiny camp of Jeddo the Crow,
Jeddo having lost his own tank wagon by reason
of careless chocking on the gondola which was
to have brought it west, and not being financially
able to buy a new one.</p>

<p>“Hey, Demi, how’ll you trade jobs?”</p>

<p>“Nuttin’ doin’, ol’-timer! Dis suits me.”</p>

<p>Demijohn lolled on the high seat to show just
how thoroughly it did suit him and how comfortable
were the accommodations of the water wagon.</p>

<p>“I ain’t talkin’ through me hat, ol’ settler!”</p>

<p>“Me neider, Jack. Kinda doity in dat borry
pit, ain’t she? Dat looks like doity doit to me.”</p>

<p>“You oughta know. You got half o’ Squawtooth
on yer face. This here’s the same dirt.”</p>

<p>“Wot’ll youse gi’me to trade jobs?”</p>

<p>“What’ll I give you! Say, this is gonta be good!”</p>

<p>“Gi’me ten?”</p>

<p>“Ten swift kicks!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>“Hejup, Ned!”</p>

<p>“Le’s go, white folks!”</p>

<p>But for half an hour that night in their bunk
tent each dwelt at length on the superior advantages
of his particular job and scorned the task of the
other. Then they traded.</p>

<p>Halfaman Daisy sang as he drove from camp
next morning with the empty tank wagon—sang
thusly, out of one corner of his drooping mouth:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

</div></div>

<p>He did not pass near the camp of Jeddo the
Crow on his first trip; but from a distance he
saw that the small, ragged, dirty tents were up,
saw the familiar van backed to the cook-tent door,
saw the teamsters already at work at moving dirt.
He made out the well-known figure of Abishua
Jeddo, but he saw nothing of his daughter.</p>

<p>“Some speed! She’s cleanin’ up after breakfast,
I guess. ‘The sons of Levi; Jershon and Kohath

<p>Two hours later Mr. Daisy dexterously backed
to the watering trough at the stable tent of the
Mangan-Hatton camp and emptied his tank. Then
he made another trip to Squawtooth Ranch, and
on the return stopped his wagon abreast a small
galvanized tank beside the cook-tent door of Jeddo
the Crow.</p>

<p>“Hey, in there! In the cook tent! Wake up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>

<p>“Oh! Why, howdy do, Miss Wing o’ the
Crow Jeddo! This is a surprise, as the fella says.
Welcome to our city! Nice mornin’, I’ll say!”</p>

<p>Breast heaving, Wing o’ the Crow stood in the
cook-tent door, black eyes wide but narrowing.
Dough and flour covered her brown bare arms.</p>

<p>“Well, for Heaven’s sake! Was all the jails full
in Nebrasky?”</p>

<p>Halfaman clambered lightly down over the wide-tired
wheels. A painful grin creased his freckled
face as he sidled toward the door.</p>

<p>“Hello, honey,” he said. “How’s every little
insignificant item?”</p>

<p>“Well, you got a nerve!” said Wing o’ the
Crow. “Who put you on that water wagon?”</p>

<p>“I did, Wing-o. And I rode the rods all the
way here from that little State called Nebrasky
to get on ’er and haul water to you. Slip us a
kiss, Wing-o!”</p>

<p>“I’ll slip you a poke in that rubber jaw! Go
kiss Lil o’ the Lobbies!”</p>

<p>“Now, lissen here, sweetheart! Ain’t you ever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>

to say hello to you, and you slip me a line o’
begone-sir patter like that! Didn’t I say I was
sorry? I ain’t seen Lil for six months.”</p>

<p>“Ain’t she here?”</p>

<p>“Search me! I ain’t been to Stlingbloke once.”</p>

<p>“Tell it to the marines, Halfaman!”</p>

<p>He pulled forth a roll of bills. “There’s me pay
day,” he said. “Every cent, ’ceptin’ for a shirt and
tobacco and things. I’m off that stuff. I just
slipped that time, anyway.”</p>

<p>“I heard you was drivin’ snap.”</p>

<p>“I was—till last night. Then I traded with Demijohn
and got the water wagon. I’m on it, too.”</p>

<p>“Why’d you want the tank? Snap’s better.”</p>

<p>“D’ye really wanta to know, now?”</p>

<p>“Uh-huh! Why’d ye s’pose I ast?”</p>

<p>“Well, now maybe I heard Mangan-Hatton’s tank
was supplyin’ Jeddo the Crow. What would you
say if I was to tell you that, Wing-o?”</p>

<p>“I’d say you was a nut!”</p>

<p>“That’s the right answer. Nuts about you, kiddo.
Say, I’m savin’ me jack these days. Everything’s
gonta be jake with me. No more booze—no more
slips. Now what d’ye say you an’ me——”</p>

<p>“Tell it to Lil o’ the Lobbies—she’d like to hear
it, I guess.”</p>

<p>“Aw, cut that old stuff! Be reasonable, now.
Slip us a kiss. Wing-o, and le’s ferget the bitter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>

Crow cares or not. Then I c’n get in here and
help move things along. I c’n get some stiffs,
I’ll bet. You an’ me c’n keep yer dad away from
the booze—and we’ll make some jack. Leave it to
us, kid, hey?”</p>

<p>She looked him over. “I’m sore on you, I’ll
admit,” she said at last. “I liked you a little—once,
but now it’s all off. That’s all’s to it. You
might jes’ as well trade back with Demijohn and
drive snap. ’Cause I ain’t gonta see you any more.
I can’t trust you. If you keep on haulin’ water,
you c’n find out fer yerself if the tank’s empty.
I won’t come out. So you better go back to yer
snap. I’m off you for life!”</p>

<p>“Now, lissen, honey—lissen——”</p>

<p>“On yer way! I’m busy. I’m gettin’ dinner.
You deceived me once, and you got my goat. Find
Lil o’ the Lobbies; she’ll listen to you!”</p>

<p>“Now, lissen—lissen!”</p>

<p>But the flaps of the tent had dropped, and from
inside came a hummed tune as Wing o’ the Crow
went on with her work.</p>

<p>Mr. Daisy sighed wearily, examined the galvanized
tank and filled it, then drove to the watering
trough at the stable tent, all unaware that a black
eye was peering at him through a tiny hole in the
cook tent.</p>

<p>“Can you beat it! I rambles across four States,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
eatin’ once every two days whether I felt it or
not, and trades the best snap job on the line for—what
I got! ‘I’m off you fer life,’ she says—just
like that. Slipped once—just once! Good

<p>“Now, you hold both handles tight, and kinda
jiggle the slip up an’ down, see? You gotta hold
’er jest right, er you’ll take on too much dirt to
begin with. Not too straight up and down at first,
and not too slow. Now try it.”</p>

<p>Miss Manzanita Canby, with a line in each hand
and also the handle of a scraper in each hand,
looked doubtfully at the two scrawny mules before
her.</p>

<p>“Start ’em up,” urged Wing o’ the Crow.</p>

<p>Manzanita flipped the lines and started the mules,
stooping over the slip, following it in the attitude
of a sprinter who starts with fingers touching the
ground.</p>

<p>“Now set yer slip.”</p>

<p>Manzanita lifted the handles slightly and set<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
the point of the pan in the ground. The fine dirt
began entering.</p>

<p>“Now keep liftin’ it—a little higher—a leetle
higher—but not too high, or——”</p>

<p><i>Bam!</i></p>

<p>The mules, suddenly relieved of their load lurched
forward. The pan of the slip had flopped over,
the handles striking the doubletrees with force almost
enough to snap them off. Manzanita lay
sprawled on the ground, her mouth full of sand.</p>

<p>“You let ’em go too fast, and you raised the
pan too high,” said Wing o’ the Crow gravely.
“Did it hurt you?”</p>

<p>“I never get hurt much,” Manzanita said cheerfully.
“I’m down half the time, for one reason or
another. Don’t mind me.”</p>

<p>“Now watch me,” suggested Wing o’ the Crow.</p>

<p>She picked up the lines, and with a deft flip
righted the slip. She laid hold of the handles.</p>

<p>“Hehup, Ned!” she chirruped.</p>

<p>And in almost no time the pan was full and
running over, and the team was moving off with
it toward the fill.</p>

<p>“It looks so easy when you do it,” Manzanita
complained. “Dump it and I’ll try again.”</p>

<p>“You jest watch a little,” advised Wing o’ the
Crow.</p>

<p>Manzanita felt humiliated by the words. She
thought that her efforts to become a dirt mover<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
were hampering the work. She had tried six times
to load a slip, always with the same result, except
that now and then she had managed to keep her
feet.</p>

<p>Jeddo the Crow was driving the snap team,
which is used only in loading the scrapers with
wheels. In “sticking pigs” the skinner himself loads
and drives and dumps. As Wing o’ the Crow came
down the dump with her empty slip Jeddo called
to her. Manzanita saw him hurry to camp for
something, and while he was away his daughter
let her slip team stand and drove the trio on the
snap.</p>

<p>Manzanita watched her enviously. She swung the
cumbersome eveners as easily as had her one-armed
father. Earlier in the afternoon the desert
girl had seen her driving six mules hitched to a
huge railroad plow. In the saddle Manzanita was
at home, but as a railroad builder she had shown
many shortcomings. Mart had been driven to the
mountains to build drift fence by his father. Manzanita
was lonesome. She envied this girl who
could do things that really counted. She had forgotten
her aversion to the railroad. Suddenly she
had grown ambitious to be doing something in life
besides riding over the desert on a pinto, wandering
aimlessly. She even did not wish to become a
moving picture actress now. “Life is real and life
is earnest,” she had quoted to Mrs. Ehrhart, apropos<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
of nothing at all, that morning, greatly to the
kindly housekeeper’s surprise.</p>

<p>She sighed pensively now; and when Jeddo returned
and Wing o’ the Crow drove into the borrow
pit with the slip team again, she arose from her
seat on a felled yucca.</p>

<p>“I guess I’d better be riding home, Wing-o,”
she said. “I’ve lots to do. I’ll see you to-morrow
maybe, if I can find the time.”</p>

<p>Whereupon she mounted her mare and galloped
toward Squawtooth.</p>

<p>At the ranch she threw off the big saddle and
corralled the mare. It was four o’clock in the afternoon.
She hurried to the low adobe house and
entered the kitchen.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Ehrhart,” she said, “is there anything for
me to do toward getting supper?”</p>

<p>The housekeeper turned from her glossy range
and gazed at her in consternation.</p>

<p>“Child, are you sick?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” returned Manzanita “I’m quite well,
thank you. I just thought if there was nothing
I could do here right now, I’d get at that alfalfa.”</p>

<p>“Get at the alfalfa! What alfalfa?”</p>

<p>“Why, our alfalfa. It needs irrigating badly. I
heard Pa Squawtooth say so.”</p>

<p>At which she left the kitchen and the speechless
housekeeper.</p>

<p>A little later Squawtooth Canby rode in on his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
big black and found his rubber hip boots walking
around and carrying a shovel. So he expressed it,
anyway. But in reality the boots had a motive
power not their own, for Manzanita, with her skirt
tucked into the tops of them, was responsible for
their sluggish progress.</p>

<p>Canby stopped his horse and gazed at the apparition.</p>

<p>“Nita, what in th’ name o’ Heaven are you doin’
in them boots?”</p>

<p>“Irrigatin’.”</p>

<p>“Is the water runnin’ on the ’falfy?”</p>

<p>“Yep. I turned her on. It needed it pretty
badly, pa.”</p>

<p>“Why, that patch was irrigated only last week,
girl!” he cried. “It’s the tent north o’ the house
that’s dry.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said Manzanita. “I didn’t know. I heard
you say—— I haven’t hurt anything, have I, pa?”</p>

<p>He dismounted deliberately and walked toward
her, chuckling as he thought of the size of the
feet within his number eleven boots.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with ye, daughter?” he asked,
kissing her.</p>

<p>“I have awakened,” said Manzanita. “I realize
that my life has been wasted. I’ve been a useless
creature—a drone—a millstone about the neck of
progress.”</p>

<p>“Wait a minute! How’s that?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>“But it’s not too late,” she went on. “It is
never too late. From now on I mean to accomplish
things before undreamed of. I am not only
going to help about the housework, but during
my spare moments I mean to work outside and
develop this ranch. I’m sorry I got the wrong
alfalfa patch. I’ll shut off the water here and start
it over there. Go on and do whatever is necessary,
pa, and don’t worry about the alfalfa. I feel like a
new being already. My coma is over.”</p>

<p>“Your which?”</p>

<p>“My coma. I’ve been asleep—stunned—dazed.
But thank goodness I see myself in the true light
at last.”</p>

<p>“How d’ye keep them boots on?”</p>

<p>“I don’t. They stick every now and then, and
I can’t pull ’em out of the mud. Then I have
to step out and lift them free with my hands. I’m
barefooted inside the boots.”</p>

<p>“And d’ye wash yer feet before ye put ’em in
the boots ag’in?”</p>

<p>“Well—no. I can’t very well. They get all
muddy again if I do. I’ll have to have smaller
boots.”</p>

<p>“And how d’ye think I’m to get the mud outa
the inside o’ them boots? Don’t they hurt yer
feet, Nita?”</p>

<p>“Terribly. Little rocks get in. But I can stand
it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>Here her father’s weakening gravity forsook him
entirely, and with his long arms he swept up boots,
shovel, and girl and carried them to the house.</p>

<p>“I guess we got men enough round here to
irrigate the ’falfy,” he said as he set her down
on the old Mexican doorstep, a foot thick and a
foot high. “Now I’m gonta put up the black, and
time I get back here you have them boots off an’
washed out, and yer feet washed and all, and then
we’ll find out about this new ambition o’ yours.
I’m interested, I’ll admit. Get busy, now!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX<br>

<small>DUSK ON THE DESERT</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">LARDO the Cook and The Falcon’s fellow
flunkies had left the cook tent for the day.
Falcon the Flunky poured boiling water over the
knives and forks and spoons in a gigantic dishpan
and hurriedly dried them. Then he removed his
apron and scoured the kitchen odors from his hands,
combed his brown hair, and called it a day.</p>

<p>Outside he tied the flaps of the tent against erratic
winds of the night, and, turning away, strolled off
over the desert.</p>

<p>The red glow of the summer sun still hung over
the mountains to the west, making a host of speared
warriors of the pines that lived on the ridges and
lighting the desert. Between hummocks of sand
blown up about greasewood bushes Falcon the
Flunky wound his way, with lizards that had
lingered for the last rays of sunlight scampering
to cover before his feet.</p>

<p>He wandered north, smoking a cigarette, his
hands locked behind him, deeply brooding. To
the west a black speck took form in contrast with
the sable dusk colors of the desert. The Falcon
saw it; his pulse quickened. At the same time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
he frowned and sighed as if all were not well
with his soul.</p>

<p>On toward him moved the black speck, growing
larger as it came. He thought of a fly fallen in
Lardo’s big bowl of flapjack batter, swimming
desperately toward solid footing. Lardo’s long white
forefinger might scoop up the bedraggled insect
and hurl it with a battery spat against the tent
wall. But to think of Lardo the Cook as fate
or destiny or any other of the forces that control
nature brought a smile to the flunky’s lips. But
the desert was big and flat and awe-inspiring, and
the human speck moving over its vast expanse
seemed as helpless and insignificant as the ill-fated
fly.</p>

<p>Presently Falcon the Flunky waved his hat. Before
long Manzanita Canby reined in the blowing
pinto mare beside him and dismounted.</p>

<p>“Hello!” she greeted, her face lighted with color,
her hazel eyes half hidden by long lashes.</p>

<p>Falcon the Flunky silently took the mare’s reins,
and she trailed the pair as they walked on into the
north.</p>

<p>“Doesn’t the desert seem big to-night,” remarked
the girl. “When the sun goes down it seems to
expand, and then as darkness comes on it contracts
more and more, till finally you’re all shut in.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said simply; and for a time they
walked on silently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>“Why are you so still this evening?” asked
Manzanita. “Is there something the matter?”</p>

<p>Falcon the Flunky cleared his throat. “I’ve been
thinking,” he told her, “that we oughtn’t to meet
like this, Manzanita.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“For one thing, your father wouldn’t approve.
And back there at camp they can’t help knowing
about it.”</p>

<p>“Well? I’m of age. I can do as I choose.
If I want to be with you, it’s nobody’s business,
is it?”</p>

<p>“That’s the old, old, commonplace defense,” he
said. “But they’re wondering and chuckling in
their sleeves back there in camp. And that won’t
do where you’re concerned. They can’t understand,
of course. If you have a friend in camp,
he should be Hunter Mangan or the walking boss,
or perhaps one of the bookkeepers—not one of the
stiffs, a flunky.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you know you’re not a flunky, so far as
that goes! And so does every one, I guess.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps. But that doesn’t help matters. It’s a
rather difficult subject for a man to talk upon.
You’re used to men—accustomed to being comradely
with them. So you don’t exactly see the difference,
now that the camps have come. And to save my
soul I can’t exactly explain it myself. Somehow
or other, I should think it right and proper for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
you to be friendly and democratic with your cowmen,
but it’s different with the stiffs. And I can’t
tell you why or how, but I feel it.”</p>

<p>“What old hens all men are!” and Manzanita
sighed. “Pa Squawtooth and Hunt Mangan, and
now even you! Nobody ever takes the time to
insult me. No man ever has insulted me.”</p>

<p>“Not to your face, perhaps,” said The Falcon
significantly.</p>

<p>“Well, if you don’t want me to come and walk
with you——” Manzanita’s chin was a trifle elevated.</p>

<p>“Can’t I go to the ranch sometimes of evenings
instead?”</p>

<p>For quite a time she withheld her reply.</p>

<p>“I—I hardly think so,” she told him finally.</p>

<p>“Your father wouldn’t approve, of course.”</p>

<p>“I—I’m afraid that’s it.”</p>

<p>“All the more reason, then, why we should not
meet out here on the desert. Listen: I’m going
to ask you what may seem to be an unfair question—from
a man. Why did you make friends with
me so readily in the cook tent the first day you
came to the camp?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps I liked you,” she suggested in a low
tone.</p>

<p>“No, you didn’t. You knew nothing about me
then. I was no more to you than Lardo the Cook
or Baldy or Rambo the Bouncer.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>“Does a person have to know all about another
before she can like his looks—and—and other things
about him? I’m rather an instinctive person.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but you don’t trust to instinct altogether.
I think you had a reason for offering me friendship.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps I had—then,” she admitted after a
little. “But it’s been different since. It was silly,
I suppose—stupid. But I liked you almost at
once; and when I like a person I’m not slow to
show it.”</p>

<p>“I believe you,” he said. “Otherwise I’d not
be here with you now. But tell me what was the
beginning of it all.”</p>

<p>Another pause. Then: “I’d rather not—just yet.”</p>

<p>“All right. I’ll not press you for an answer.
But I imagine it’s hardly necessary. I think I
know.”</p>

<p>“But you can’t!”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I can. I think I almost knew even
that first day. But now about seeing you in the
future. I want to, of course, and I think you
want me to. I believe I’ll walk over to the ranch
to-morrow evening and call on you. Would there
be a great upheaval?”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid there would be—afterward. You
see, Pa Squawtooth is pretty much of a snob.
I have to admit it. He’s been getting pretty well<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
off the last few years; and now this railroad will
make him rich, he thinks. For my part, I have
no desire to be wealthy—but that has nothing to
do with the situation. Pa’s only a money snob,
though. He’s democratic enough other ways, and
has always encouraged me to be the same. That
is, up until lately. Since I’ve grown up I notice
he doesn’t approve of many of the things I do. We
have dances around here sometimes. I used always
to go with Ed Chazzy or ‘Lucky’ Gilfoyle or Splicer
Kurtz, or some other desert rat, and he’d say nothing.
But now he takes me himself, or tags along;
and if I’m with any particular vaquero two minutes
longer than I’m with any of the others he nearly
strokes his whispers out. In fact, he’s told me
outright that, since he’s becoming rich, I mustn’t
be too free with the cow-punchers and all that.
Now, if ‘Limpy’ Pardoe, for instance, were to
strike it rich in a gold claim that he does assessment
work on every year, why, I’ll bet pa would
let me dance with him. So you see what kind
of a snob he is—just a money snob, not a folks
snob. And it’s so new I haven’t got used to it.
It came on him all of a sudden when beef sold
so high, and the railroad began to boom up. He’ll
get over it. I hope so, anyway. So you see—well,
I don’t know whether he’d like you or not.
That is, admit he liked you. And he’d probably
ask me not to invite you to come again. Then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
I’d have to meet you like this, if I saw you at
all, while now I just do it.”</p>

<p>“Suppose we try it, anyway,” he suggested.
“Maybe he’ll like me despite himself. Do I sound
egotistical—too confident? But maybe we can break
him of this newly formed habit.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” she said skeptically. “He and
I had a long talk last night. He came home and
found me irrigating the alfalfa. You see, I’d begun
to realize what a useless life I’ve been living. I
think I grew up in a day when I saw Wing o’ the
Crow sticking pigs and driving a team, then hurrying
to camp to get a meal for the stiffs. So I
decided to remodel my life. I went home, and as
there was nothing I could do in the house, I put
on rubber boots and went to irrigating. I had tried
to help Wing-o, but I proved a failure at sticking
pigs. I was hopeless for a time, then suddenly I
realized that I was trying to do something out
of my sphere, and that that was the trouble. So
I went home and began in my own sphere to make
amends. And then pa took me to the house; it was
then that we had our talk.”</p>

<p>“And do you wish to tell me about it?”</p>

<p>“Well, he said irrigating wasn’t my sphere, either.
He wants me to practice more on the piano and
study more and do housework—if I must work—and
not run around so much, and—and——”</p>

<p>“Yes?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>“Well, grow up a little more, he said—and think
about getting married and settling down.”</p>

<p>“Good advice, I should say.”</p>

<p>“And he said I ought to take more interest in
the men he brings to the ranch from Los Angeles
sometimes, and in—in Hunter Mangan.”</p>

<p>“Oh!”</p>

<p>“Mangan has lots of money, pa says; and he’s
not so terribly old—twenty-nine. Of course, you
know he comes over to Squawtooth often. Pa
invites him. And, by the way, he’s to be there
for supper to-morrow night. So you wouldn’t want
to come then.”</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t I? I’ll come if you invite me.”</p>

<p>“I would, of course—you know. But I’m afraid
it might spoil everything.”</p>

<p>“I’ll risk it. Suppose I go and try to make your
father like me, even though I’m only a flunky.”</p>

<p>“If you want to try it——”</p>

<p>“Do you invite me?”</p>

<p>“Certainly. But—but——”</p>

<p>“It’s settled then. We’ll see what can be done
to cure your father of this sudden complaint. Now
let’s talk of something else.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>While these two walked slowly over the soft
carpet of sand Mr. Halfaman Daisy was repairing
to the camp of Jeddo the Crow, swinging along
with an exalted stride. As he strode along he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
lifted his voice in song, or, rather, dropped it out
of one corner of his mouth, to convince himself that
his head was still unbowed. And thus he sang the
ninety-seventh and the hundred-and-sixth stanzas of
his favorite lay:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Chi to the Kerry Woman’s out in Sac</div>
<div class="verse">I rides the rods—ain’t a-comin’ back.</div>
<div class="verse">She slips me a dollar and I buys a stack,</div>
<div class="verse">And I holds four aces on a lumberjack—</div>
<div class="indent">For his pay day—for me ba-bay!</div>
<div class="verse">For the pay day of that lumberjack!</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Starts for Dallas on the M. K. and T.,</div>
<div class="verse">In a Memphis town I caught the ole I. C.</div>
<div class="verse">Tanked up in Chi on the M. and Saint P.,</div>
<div class="verse">And a-sobered up in Frisco on the Santa Fee—</div>
<div class="indent">Without me pay day—for me ba-bay!</div>
<div class="verse">Without me pay day from the M. K. and T!”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>As he drew near to the blinking lights of Jeddo’s
camp his song trailed off; and when he reached the
front of the cook tent he was silent altogether.</p>

<p>The cook tent was dark, and its flaps tied together
inhospitably, proving that its presiding angel had
thriftily finished her work for the day. Mr. Daisy
walked around it, stumbled over a guy rope, righted
himself and the new pink tie which he fondly imagined
went well with his sandy kinks, and continued
his approach toward the van in the rear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>Mr. Daisy cleared his throat and knocked on the
oaken doubletrees. Achieving nothing beyond a
faint, unresounding tattoo and aching knuckle bones,
he repeated the signal on the wagon box.</p>

<p>“Well? Who’s there?” came from within.</p>

<p>“Hello, Wing-o! It’s me. How’s each trivial
detail this large evening?”</p>

<p>“The can’s three quarters full. You filled ’er
this mornin’, you remember.”</p>

<p>“I did, at that I’d forgotten. I’m afoot now,
though, Wing-o.”</p>

<p>“Keep that way.”</p>

<p>“You ain’t gone to bed?”</p>

<p>“How d’ye know I ain’t?”</p>

<p>Mr. Daisy pondered over this. “I don’t,” he
finally confessed. “But lissen here, Wing-o: I got
somethin’ to tell you.”</p>

<p>“Never saw you when you didn’t have somethin’
to tell somebody.”</p>

<p>“Ha-ha! You sure got on yer kid gloves to-night,
sw-sweetheart.”</p>

<p>“I don’t need ’em to handle the likes o’ you.
Peddle that ‘sw-sweetheart’ stuff where its welcome.”</p>

<p>“Aw, say now! I was afraid you wasn’t gonta
think o’ that. Lissen, deary—honest I got somethin’
to tell you.”</p>

<p>“I can’t believe it!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>“Somethin’ big, too. It’ll make yer eyes stick
out.”</p>

<p>“It would if I was to swallow it, I guess. But
you never saw me have to push ’em in with a
pick handle after listenin’ to you, did you?”</p>

<p>“Ain’t you the cuttin’ kid, though! But honest,
pettie—this here’s great. Honest!”</p>

<p>“Pettie! Say, how’d you get that way?”</p>

<p>“Are you gonta ask me to climb up and set on
the seat and talk to you?”</p>

<p>“Nobody ever had to ask you to talk to ’em.
Trouble is to get you to break it off so’s a body
c’n get a mite o’ sleep now an’ then. But go on—say
what you got to say. I reckon it’s cruelty
to animals to stop you.”</p>

<p>“Did you say climb up, Wing-o?”</p>

<p>“If I did I was talkin’ in my sleep. I been asleep
for ten minutes. You always put me to sleep.
Maybe it was me snorin’ you heard.”</p>

<p>“Aw, now le’s cut out the funny stuff! I’m
comin’ up there. Shall I?”</p>

<p>“I thought you said you was comin’.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to unless you want me to.”</p>

<p>“It’s a cinch you don’t want to, then!”</p>

<p>“H’m-m!” muttered the cornered Mr. Daisy.
“Well, I’m comin’ up, anyway,” he added, and
climbed on the wagon tongue.</p>

<p>“Shall I?”</p>

<p>“Shall you what?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>“Come on up? I’m standin’ on the tongue.”</p>

<p>“Not your own. I’d get a little rest if you was.”</p>

<p>“H’m-m!” Halfaman Daisy raised himself to
his full height, though not in outraged dignity,
and peered in over the seat. “Here I am,” he
announced in doubtful triumph.</p>

<p>In one corner of the van was a cot, just large
enough for the tired little body that slept on it
night after night. About the walls hung the meager
wardrobe of the queen of the van. There was a
tiny homemade table with writing materials, a few
books, and a kerosene lamp on it. Before it, in a
camp chair, sat the girl of Mr. Daisy’s heart.</p>

<p>Her black hair was down and in a state of
picturesque disorder. Someway, the more tumbled
her hair, the more fascinating to mankind was the
daughter of the one-armed Jeddo. She wore a
straight, formless lightweight dress of brown and
white plaid—a homely thing on any other woman.</p>

<p>“Heavens, you’re pretty!” Halfaman Daisy said
fervently. “You start the joy bells ringin’ in me
heart. What’re you doin’?”</p>

<p>“Studyin’.” The tones were more soothing. Mr.
Daisy had said much in those last few words.</p>

<p>“’Rithmetic?”</p>

<p>“Yep—an’ hist’ry.”</p>

<p>“How much is two an’ a quarter times thirty?”</p>

<p>She figured with a pencil. “Sixty-seven-fifty,”
she reported.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>“Less two-fifty fer a shirt and a dollar fer
tobacco, an’ fifty cents fer this here tie I’m wearin’?”</p>

<p>After a pause: “Sixty-three dollars and fifty
cents.”</p>

<p>“That’s what’s right here in me jeans, kiddo. The
way I’m hoardin’ it up these days is what’s makin’
hard times. I’m gonta set on the seat, Wing-o.”</p>

<p>As she did not dispute this he clambered to the
seat and sat facing her, his legs draped over the
low back uncomfortably. He took from his pocket
the stub of a pencil and abstractedly wrote on the
seat back between his long legs: “And the sons
also of Aaron; Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and
Ithamar.”</p>

<p>“Don’t begat all over that there seat!” warned
the girl. “Can’t you think of anything but ‘The
sons also of Aaron?’ You talk it an’ dream it an’
write it everywhere you go. You’re a begatto-maniac,
Jack!”</p>

<p>Mr. Daisy wet the rubber eraser and tried to
obliterate the words. “Bring your chair over here
by me,” he suggested.</p>

<p>“I’m doin’ well enough right here, thank you.
Why don’t you get ye a rubber stamp with that
Aaron business on it, an’ have it and a pad handy
in your pocket?”</p>

<p>“Huh! But I got somethin’ to tell you.”</p>

<p>“I’ll begin to b’lieve that pretty soon. Or you
might get you one o’ these little typewriters they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
carry in a case. ’Twouldn’t be heavy. You could
keep it on yer tank wagon and begat all the way
to Squawtooth an’ back.”</p>

<p>“Huh! Come on over closter. I oughtn’t to
butt in there, an’ I gotta talk low. This here’s an
important secret.”</p>

<p>She shrugged, rose, and carried her camp chair
nearer to the wagon seat, setting it down so that
she would be safely out of the reach of this obstinate
male.</p>

<p>“They c’n hear me all over camp. This here’s
sumpin just between you an’ me.”</p>

<p>With a pout Wing o’ the Crow rose again and
moved the chair nearer. But as she started to sit
down Halfaman reached out and moved it nearer
still, so that she alighted on the bare edge of it
and was saved from toppling off by his ready
hand. Apparently she considered the near catastrophe
as due to her own awkwardness, for she
said nothing to show that she thought her lover
responsible.</p>

<p>“Well, shoot!” she encouraged, demurely folding
her hands in her lap.</p>

<p>Mr. Daisy leaned so that his lips were close to
her little ear and shot.</p>

<p>“Kid, I’m crazy about you!” was the ammunition
that he used.</p>

<p>“Aw, bunk! Is that all ye got to tell me?”</p>

<p>She made as if to rise immediately, but Halfaman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
grasped the chair, and of course she could not rise
and leave the chair to withstand these indignities
alone.</p>

<p>“Don’t you believe me? You know you do!
Why’m I here?—tell me that. Why’d I ramble
West?—tell me that!”</p>

<p>“Maybe Lil o’ the Lobbies could.”</p>

<p>“Aw, now, sweetheart, that ain’t fair! You
know that’s all past. Listen: I got somethin’ to
tell you.”</p>

<p>“Yeah? Where’ve I heard that before?”</p>

<p>“Now listen. You think I’m kiddin’ you. How
’bout that little Squawtooth girl?”</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s her now, is it? You big stiff—she
wouldn’t use you for a doormat!”</p>

<p>“Maybe not; maybe not. Just the same, you’re
all wrong again. She likes you. She slipped it
to me that she did, to-day when I was at the
ranch. Did she ever say anything to you ’bout me?”</p>

<p>“Her! About you! Say, this is good! Why,
say, Halfaman—she can’t talk about anything else.”</p>

<p>Halfaman removed his broken-visored cap and
scratched his head. “You’re kiddn’ me again,” he
decided. “But did she?”</p>

<p>“You poor fish, she don’t know you’re on earth!”</p>

<p>“Maybe not; maybe not. Just the same, there’s
one stiff she’s keen enough about. And I thought
maybe she said sumpin about him—see? If she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
did, she mighta mentioned me. ’Cause this bird
and me’s pals. They call um Falcon the Flunky.
How ’bout it?”</p>

<p>“She said somethin’ about a stiff with a moniker
like that first time I met her,” admitted Wing o’
the Crow, her curiosity aroused.</p>

<p>“What’d she say, apple blossoms?”</p>

<p>“Say, for Heaven’s sake. Apple blossoms! You’re
kinda nutty, ain’t you? She just said he was at
Mangan-Hatton’s.”</p>

<p>“Uh-huh—he’s s’posed to be a flunky there. Is,
fer that matter. But everybody don’t know what
I know about um. Him an’ me’s pals, and he slipped
me the dope about umself last night. I’ll bet you’d
open yer eyes if you savvied what I do, Wing-o.
An’ lissen—you don’t wanta ferget about that guy.
He’s strong for me, and I’ll bet if you knew what
I do you wouldn’t be so placid, kinda.”</p>

<p>“You talk like a Hamburger sandwich! I heard
you say you had somethin’ to tell me.”</p>

<p>“Ain’t I tellin’ you? But I can tell you more:
This little Canby girl is nuts about Falcon the
Flunky. First day she was in camp she was there
to see Mangan. An’ Mangan he was showin’ her
’round—see—and when he takes ’er to the cook
shack she sees Falcon the Flunky, and from then
on she gives Mangan the begone sir. Lissen: Every
night Falcon the Flunky beats it out over the desert,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
and pretty soon here she comes to meet um from
the ranch. Everybody’s onto it—even Mangan.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe it!”</p>

<p>“It’s the truth, so help me! But lissen: There’s
a joker. If you knew this Falcon the Flunky an’
what I do about um you’d savvy. Nobody knows
it but me—see?”</p>

<p>“I’ll bet he’s crooked. Well?”</p>

<p>“Well, I can’t tell you much, ’cause he tells me
not to spill it. But Falcon the Flunky’s an educated
guy, and—and he’s there, that’s all. Believe
me, kiddo, that guy’s a go-getter!”</p>

<p>“You talk like a man up a tree! I thought ye
had somethin’ to tell me. Just trying to horn in
as usual?”</p>

<p>“There’s lots to tell, but I dassent spill it. No
foolin’! And lissen: It’s got lots to do with you
an’ me, kiddo.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know where I come in.”</p>

<p>“Why, this plug’s me pal—see? An’ you’re me
little gypo queen that I rambled acrost four States
to see again.”</p>

<p>“Is that so?”</p>

<p>“Sure. An’ one o’ these days you’ll say: ‘Gee!
I never savvied that guy was the reg’lar feller he
is. Say, I was rubber from the chin up when
I slipped that Jasper them unkind words!’ No
foolin’! You wait an’ see! Later on everything’ll<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
be jake, and there’ll be some eye openin’ in this
shanty camp. No foolin’! Gettin’ sleepy, honey?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no—not a-tall.”</p>

<p>“I guess you are. Well, I’ll beat it. Any chance
fer a little kiss? Then I’ll go.”</p>

<p>“Not the slightest in the world.”</p>

<p>Mr. Daisy sighed as does one who has quested
long in vain, and turned on the seat.</p>

<p>“Well, good night,” he said as he climbed to
the ground. “The day’s comin’, though—an’ she
ain’t far off—when you’ll say: ‘Sucker that I was!
I coulda had that fella Daisy fer just sayin’ a word.
But I wasted me opportunity. Now look at um!
And it’s too late—too late!’”</p>

<p>“Is that all?” asked Wing o’ the Crow.</p>

<p>“All for the present.”</p>

<p>“Good night!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X<br>

<small>GUESTS</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">SQUAWTOOTH CANBY was finding his new
rôle a difficult one. As his devoted daughter
had expressed it, he was not a “folks snob,” but
merely a “money snob,” and a new and inexperienced
one at that. The warm hospitality of Squawtooth
Ranch was a byword in this section of the
country. Any man, vaquero, miner, prospector,
homesteader, or the chance wayfarer from the inside
of the range was welcome at Squawtooth so
long as he showed the slightest evidences of being
a gentleman as the term is interpreted in the outland
West. Penniless prospectors and underpaid
cow-punchers for years had sat at table
with the master of the squat old adobe and the
master’s daughter, and no member of the household
ever had thought of considering them anything
but equals. To break the custom of a lifetime
is a difficult matter; and to-night Webster
Canby found himself perplexed as how to treat
his guests. Falcon the Flunky and Hunter Mangan.</p>

<p>He had not known that the first named was to
be a guest until shortly before his arrival. He
had come afoot five minutes ahead of Mangan, who
arrived on horseback. When Manzanita had seen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
him walking in from the desert she had told her
father that she herself had invited a guest for
supper, and there had been little time before The
Falcon’s arrival for questions. She introduced him,
when he stepped over the high threshold, as Mr.
Falcon of the Mangan-Hatton camp.</p>

<p>This was a busy time of year for Squawtooth
Canby, and he had not found much opportunity to
visit his new friend’s camp. Therefore it was not surprising
that he never before had met a man called
Mr. Falcon. The visitor was hardly dressed as a
member of the camp’s royal family would be—in
khaki or corduroy and puttees—but he was
nevertheless presentable. Dress clothes of any kind
were almost unknown to most of the men who came
to Squawtooth, so in this The Falcon was not
amiss.</p>

<p>During the short conversation that time allowed
the two men before the arrival of Hunt Mangan,
nothing was asked and nothing volunteered in regard
to The Falcon’s place in the Mangan-Hatton
camp. Squawtooth at once realized his guest’s refinement
and education. Naturally supposing him to
be of importance to the work, else Manzanita would
not have invited him to be a guest with Mangan,
he was getting on famously when Mangan came.</p>

<p>Manzanita met the contractor at the door and
brought him in. Mangan’s eyes widened as he saw
Falcon the Flunky, and for a moment he looked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
bewilderedly at the girl. Then his native refinement
asserted itself, and he shook hands cordially, if a
little awkwardly, with Canby and his fellow guest.</p>

<p>At once Manzanita went to help Mrs. Ehrhart
with the dinner, leaving the three men together.
The Falcon sat listening to the conversation of
Canby and Mangan, not offering a word but perfectly
at ease. Presently he stepped to the piano,
glanced over the music on the rack, and seated
himself on the stool.</p>

<p>“Don’t mind if I loosen up a little, do you?”
he asked, smiling around at them. “I see a piano
so seldom these days that I can’t keep away from
one when I do.”</p>

<p>“Sure! Sure!” genially encouraged Squawtooth.
“Give us a tune.”</p>

<p>Thereupon Falcon the Flunky played several semi-classical
pieces with a touch and feeling that surprised
Mangan, who appreciated good music. As
he talked with his host he watched the man at the
piano. Where had he come from? Who was he?
Was he playing the instrument merely to prove that
he was socially above the general run of construction
laborers?</p>

<p>The Falcon swiveled presently on the stool and
sat listening again to the conversation.</p>

<p>“You’re pretty good at that, Mr. Falcon,” volunteered
Canby, to whom almost any noise on an
instrument meant music.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>The Falcon smiled. “Pretty rusty, I imagine.
I haven’t touched a piano in three months.”</p>

<p>“We was talkin’ about the new railroad bridge
over the Little Albert,” Squawtooth observed. “Mr.
Mangan says she’ll hold, but I tell him he don’t
realize what a torrent that river c’n be when the
snows thaw up in the mountains. What d’you
think about ’er, Mr. Falcon?”</p>

<p>“I’ve seen the abutments only once,” replied The
Falcon, “but it strikes me that you have grounds for
what you say, Mr. Canby. I’m afraid such a
bottom as this sandy country will give is not going
to be——”</p>

<p>“Right there’s the idea. They ain’t goin’ deep
enough, and them abutments are too light. But o’
course they know more about it than I do.”</p>

<p>The ghost of a smile was playing over Hunt
Mangan’s lips. While he was not vitally concerned
with the bridge contract or its outcome, he knew
that Foster &amp; Bean, who were doing the quarry
work, were unsurpassed in their line, and he had
perfect confidence in their judgment.</p>

<p>Canby continued to explain the treachery of the
sand-bottom rivers of the West as he knew them,
speaking to his supporter. Mangan said nothing,
but watched and wondered about Falcon the Flunky.</p>

<p>That he should voice any opinion at all about
railroad work surprised him, but that he should
have tried to display a knowledge of a part of such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
work altogether foreign to that of the Mangan-Hatton
Company, evidently his first experience, was
more puzzling still. And he was not a fool! Then
the young man began to talk, and Mangan listened.
His sentences displayed a technical knowledge of
railroad building which was not at Mangan’s command.
Mangan knew his own end of the work
and nothing more. He was not an engineer, merely
a good rock man and a dirt mover. But Falcon
the Flunky talked like a man who had studied every
phase of railroad construction, from the preliminary
survey of a proposed route to the laying of the
steel. He talked not from a contractor’s viewpoint,
but from that of a high-salaried man
employed by the company whose money was
being invested, and who demanded that all phases
of the work tend toward one ultimate idea, the excellence
of their railroad.</p>

<p>Was this young man a spy in the employ of the
Gold Belt Cut-off? Was he, at his age, a technical
expert come to pose as a common laborer and
report the progress of the work? If so, why had
he chosen the Mangan-Hatton outfit as his headquarters?
There was nothing wrong with the Mangan-Hatton
work, Mangan could have sworn. No,
he was no spy. He would not have exposed his
knowledge of railroad building if he were that.
Unless he had thrown overboard all his plans, and
was doing this solely to convince Canby that he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
was as good as the best of them. And Manzanita
could be the only excuse for such a foolish play
at that.</p>

<p>It was not until after dinner—supper as it invariably
was called at Squawtooth—that Canby and
Mangan found themselves alone, Manzanita having
taken The Falcon away to show him that ever
interesting marvel on a ranch, “the cutest little
calf, born only last night.” The cattleman and the
contractor were left on the broad Spanish veranda,
smoking cigars. Mangan’s host cleared his throat
apologetically.</p>

<p>“I expect I hadn’t oughta ask it, Mr. Mangan,”
he began; “but, d’ye know, I never heard tell o’
Mr. Falcon until to-night! He got here just before
you did, and I didn’t know he was comin’ until
he was openin’ the gate. Little Apple didn’t tell
me anything about ’im, and I didn’t ask. Oughtn’t
to be askin’ you, I reckon, but it seems funny I
never heard you mention ’im. Am I impolite?
Who is he? Smart as a cricket, ain’t he?”</p>

<p>“I must confess,” replied Hunt Mangan slowly,
“that I know very little about him myself.” The
contractor spoke abstractedly. He was thinking of
“Little Apple,” of which “Manzanita” is the Spanish
equivalent. He never before had heard the
girl called that.</p>

<p>“Been with you long?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>“Oh, Fal—er—Mr. Falcon, eh? Why, he’s been
with us since we came to Squawtooth.”</p>

<p>“Seems to me I’ve seen ’im somewheres. Say—I
got it! Wasn’t he the fella that come into the
ho-tel the day I rode to Opaco to see you, before
you’d moved out? Wasn’t he the fella that was
pardners with the man you give a dollar to—to
eat on?”</p>

<p>“I—I believe he did come to me that day.”</p>

<p>Squawtooth Canby’s craggy eyebrows came down.
“Why, you pretty near didn’t hire him, ’cause he
said he wasn’t much of a skinner!”</p>

<p>“I believe something like that came up,” conceded
Hunt after a pause, during which he had hoped
the cowman would continue speaking.</p>

<p>“And you give ’im the job o’ flunky—pot-walloper!”</p>

<p>Again the pause; and finally the contractor had
to admit it.</p>

<p>“Well, by cripes!” exclaimed Squawtooth, his
bushy brows drawn lower still. Then he raised
them suddenly and eyed his guest with a look of
shrewdness.</p>

<p>“Hunt,” he accused, “you’re keepin’ somethin’
back. And whether it’s polite er not, I gotta
know it now. Come acrost. What’s the fella’s
name? Who is he? What’s he doin’ for you?”</p>

<p>“Really, Mr. Canby, I’ve told you all I know
about him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>“You c’n tell me what he’s doin’ for you, I
reckon.”</p>

<p>“He’s working in the kitchen,” Mangan was
obliged to admit reluctantly.</p>

<p>“Did you ever get his name? He wouldn’t give
it down at Opaco that time.”</p>

<p>“He is still on the books as Falcon the Flunky,
as I wrote him down when he got the job. He’s
drawn no pay as yet, so there has been no check
made out to him. Really, I can tell you nothing
more about him.”</p>

<p>“Funny deal! How’d Nita get acquainted with
’im?”</p>

<p>Mangan told of the meeting, without embellishment.</p>

<p>“Huh! Funny! I beg yer pardon, Hunt. Come
on out now an’ I’ll show ye our new pipe line
to the new ’falfy field I’m layin’ off.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Squawtooth’s guests had taken their leave, walking
side by side toward the lights of the camp
twinkling across the black desert, Mangan leading
his saddle horse.</p>

<p>“Manzanita!”—from the front veranda.</p>

<p>“Yes, pa?”</p>

<p>“Come out here a little, will ye? I wanta have
a little <i>habla</i> with ye.”</p>

<p>The girl stepped over the high threshold and
stood in the dark beside her father.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>“Set down,” he said, relighting his cigar.</p>

<p>She sat in a reed chair beside him.</p>

<p>“Daughter,” he began, “tell me what ye know
’bout Falcon the Flunky.”</p>

<p>“Oh! So Mr. Mangan——”</p>

<p>“Stop right here, Nita!”</p>

<p>She was silent a little. “Yes, I shouldn’t have
started that,” she confessed. “Hunt’s all right. If
he said anything at all, you forced it out of him.”</p>

<p>“I did—sorta agin’ my will, at that. But I
hadta know. It wasn’t curiosity and pokin’ into
another man’s affairs. It concerned you, and I had
a right to know. Wasn’t much said. I chopped it
off and waited for you to tell me. Go on.”</p>

<p>“Well, didn’t you like him?”</p>

<p>“M’m—I thought I was questionin’ you, Nita?”</p>

<p>“I’m not on the carpet, am I, pa? If there’s
anything to be discussed, why not just talk and
question each other and answer each other?”</p>

<p>“Well, then, what if I did like ’im?”</p>

<p>“That’s why I asked him to come.”</p>

<p>“Don’t get ye.”</p>

<p>“I wanted you to meet him, not knowing he is
a camp flunky, and like him for himself. Didn’t
you?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he replied. “I admit I kinda took to
the boy, though all the time I thought I’d seen
’im before somewheres. And I had.” He explained
briefly. “He’s smart, and he’s got education. He’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
there! From an ignorant man’s viewpoint, I’d
say he knows more railroad buildin’ in a minute
than Hunt Mangan does in a year. In a big way,
I mean. But that’s neither here ner there. Who
is he?”</p>

<p>“Pa, I actually can’t tell you any more about
him than Hunter Mangan could. And I know
that was next to nothing.”</p>

<p>“You mean ye don’t even know his name?”</p>

<p>“I don’t.”</p>

<p>“Ner where he’s from, ner who his folks are,
ner what he did before he come out here and
went to flunkyin’?”</p>

<p>“No, pa.”</p>

<p>“Well, by cripes! And ye invite ’im over here
to supper!”</p>

<p>“Why, is that so strange, pa? Hundreds of
strangers have been guests at Squawtooth.”</p>

<p>“Desert rats—not tramps!”</p>

<p>“Did The Falcon strike you as a no good, Pa
Squawtooth?”</p>

<p>Canby puffed his cigar till the end of it glowed
like a little moon through the smoke screen of a
forest fire.</p>

<p>“Manzanita——”</p>

<p>“Yes, pa?”</p>

<p>“Has—now—Hunter Mangan ever ast ye to
marry ’im?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>“You embarrass me. But I can’t tell a lie. He
has not.”</p>

<p>“He likes ye plenty, Nita.”</p>

<p>“I hope he does. I certainly like him.”</p>

<p>“But ye said ye wasn’t goin’ to.”</p>

<p>“I say many things. I’m older now than when
I made that remark. And even then I was not
displeased with him; I was put out at the thought
of a railroad crossing Squawtooth.”</p>

<p>“Don’t care now, do ye, Nita?”</p>

<p>“Not so much, pa. I begin to realize that other
people in the world must live, and that railroads
are necessary to their prosperity and happiness.
Everybody can’t be fortunate enough to live at
dear old Squawtooth.”</p>

<p>“Uh-huh. What if Hunt Mangan was to ask ye
to marry ’im, Manzanita?—if ye don’t resent my
impertinence.”</p>

<p>“I’d refuse, of course.”</p>

<p>“Refuse! ‘Of course!’ Why ‘of course?’”</p>

<p>“I don’t love him.”</p>

<p>“Who do ye love, daughter?”</p>

<p>“You.”</p>

<p>“Uh-huh—ye’d better! Who else?”</p>

<p>“That podheaded little Mart.”</p>

<p>“Who else?”</p>

<p>Silence answered this for a time. “Perhaps you
are impertinent, after all,” said Manzanita demurely
at last.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>“I don’t mean to be. I’m yer pa.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know that I love anybody else—the—the
way I guess you mean, pa.”</p>

<p>“Mangan’s a fine fella,” said her father after another
intermission.</p>

<p>“He is. But I don’t love him. Even if I did,
pa, you’ve made me ’fess up that he hasn’t asked
me to be his wife.”</p>

<p>“Has—now—Falcon the Flunky ast ye?”</p>

<p>“How embarrassing you can be, pa! No! No!
No!”</p>

<p>“Ain’t sore, are ye, daughter?”</p>

<p>“Of course not, silly! No railroad man has
asked me to marry him. Every vaquero in the
country has asked me half a dozen times, I guess.”</p>

<p>“Uh-huh—I imagined so. Now about this Falcon
the Flunky ag’in, daughter: he’s a kind of a winner,
ain’t he? Kinda mysterious, eh? All that? And
good to look upon—smart an’ all. What would ye
say if he was to ast ye to marry ’im?”</p>

<p>“Pa, I positively refuse to answer such a question!
Why, I’m surprised at you!”</p>

<p>“Ye didn’t say as much when I ast ye what
ye’d say if Hunt Mangan was to ast ye.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you’ve worn out my patience!”</p>

<p>“Perhaps—maybe so. We’ll drop it, then. Le’s
go to bed. It’s pretty near eleven—three hours
later’n my bedtime.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI<br>

<small>THE PINK NECKTIE</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">MR. PHINEHAS DAISY was filling his tank
wagon at Squawtooth’s artesian well and keeping
an eye on the kitchen door of the old adobe
ranch house. It was morning, and his first trip of the
day. The heart of Mr. Daisy was hopeful, and to
the accompaniment of the rushing water he sang:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Rattlesnake bit-a me nose and knees;</div>
<div class="verse">Scorpion stung me, also bees—</div>
<div class="verse">Tarantulas an’ centipedes an’ Frisco fleas,</div>
<div class="verse">But they all died a-shakin’ with the dread D. T.’s!</div>
<div class="indent">On a pay day—for me ba-bay!</div>
<div class="verse">On a pay day with the dread D. T.’s!”</div>
</div></div>

<p>Then Manzanita came from the kitchen door,
dressed for the saddle, and approached him. Mr.
Daisy promptly swept off his disreputable cap to her.</p>

<p>“Well, ma’am, how’s every little subordinate
element this mornin’?” he asked genially, above the
roar of the water. Before she could make reply he
announced: “I’d like to see you a minute, ma’am.”</p>

<p>Manzanita went over to him.</p>

<p>“Things ain’t just breakin’ right with the children
of Amram,” he gravely informed her.</p>

<p>“Why, what’s wrong?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>Mr. Daisy sighed and rested knuckles on one
bony hip.</p>

<p>“D’ye remember the first day you saw me?”</p>

<p>“Quite well.”</p>

<p>“Uh-huh. And d’ye remember me sayin’ I wanted
you to use your inflooence with a certain party
when the time was ripe?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I remember something of the kind. You
were rather vague, though.”</p>

<p>“Well, she’s ripe, ma’am.”</p>

<p>“And what do you wish me to do, Halfaman?”</p>

<p>Mr. Daisy became slightly embarrassed. He
looked at her gravely, then took from his overalls
pocket his pencil stub, thoughtfully touched his
tongue to the blunt point, and wrote on the edge
of the horse trough: “The sons also of Aaron;
Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar.”</p>

<p>Manzanita’s lips twitched as she read it. A
week before Mr. Daisy had asked permission to
use the telephone in the ranch house to relay a
message for Mangan to Opaco. After he had left,
Manzanita had found scribbled on the pad that lay
always on the telephone table: “And the children
of Amram; Aaron and Moses and Miriam. The
sons also of Aaron; Nadab and——” But at this
point, apparently, whoever Mr. Daisy had been
calling had come to the other end of the wire.</p>

<p>Presently Mr. Daisy looked up briskly, as if he
had gained inspiration from his chirographic concentration.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
“Ma’am,” he said, “I want you to slip
Wing o’ the Crow an earful o’ chatter that’ll wise
her up a little. Now lissen: There was a slip.
But that’s all past an’ gone. Wing-o, though, she
can’t ferget it—see? Now you sidle round her
and kinda say: ‘Say, Wing-o, ain’t that fella Halfaman
the limit?’</p>

<p>“‘He sure is,’ she’ll say.</p>

<p>“Then you’ll say: ‘What d’ye mean th’ limit?’</p>

<p>“And she’ll come back: ‘Ripe fer the chipmunks.’</p>

<p>“Then you: ‘Nothin’ stirrin’! You don’t get
me, kiddo. <i>I</i> think he’s great!’ See—just like
that. Course you’re stallin’—get the idea? You
don’t have to think that yerself. Just stringin’
her along—see?</p>

<p>“‘What d’ye mean great?’ maybe she’ll say.</p>

<p>“Then you: ‘Kind an’ everything—and a perfect
gentleman, even if he is a roughneck. I just think
he’s there!’ See ma’am—you know how to do it.</p>

<p>“‘I think he’s a cuckoo,’ maybe the kid’ll say.
But you don’t pay no ’tention to that, but just
keep on:</p>

<p>“‘And he’s got such good chances for the future’—see?
Like that. ‘There ain’t a stiff on the line
that’s likely to make the hit that bird’s due to pull
off pretty soon. My!’ you’ll say. ‘Some nice girl’s
missin’ a lot just because this fella’s a kind of
a woman hater.’</p>

<p>“‘What d’ye mean woman hater?’ she asks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>“‘Oh,’ you’ll say, ‘some jane turned him down,
it seems, and he’s got hard and bitter an’ everything.
He never told me nothin’ about his troubles,
but I c’n see he’s had ’em just by lookin’ in his
eyes. And he’s likely to go ’way any day now,’
you’ll say. ‘I guess he’s saved up a lotta jack,
and will be goin’ back to his old haunts and habits.’
Haunts and habits—that’ll get her! ‘Ain’t it too
bad,’ you’ll be sayin’ then. ‘A man like that oughta
have a nice girl to love ’im, and then he’d settle
down and be a credit to the country. But I guess
it’s too late!’ See—just like that. Was you goin’
over to-day to see ’er, ma’am?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I was just going to saddle up.”</p>

<p>“Then to-day’ll be a good time to spring it on
’er. And then maybe to-morrow you’ll go back
again—see—and say:</p>

<p>“‘Well, he’s gone’—blunt, you know—sudden,
kinda.</p>

<p>“‘Who’s gone?’ she’ll say. Course she savvies—see—but
she’ll stall.</p>

<p>“‘Mr. Daisy,’ you’ll be tellin’ her; and then
you’ll go to talkin’ about sumpin else. Get the
idea?”</p>

<p>“But you won’t be gone.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I will. I’ll beat it at noon on the
stage.”</p>

<p>“You’ll leave the country?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>Mr. Daisy swept his cap to the other ear and
winked. “Cameofladge,” he whispered mysteriously.</p>

<p>“Oh, I see! And what am I to do after telling
her?”</p>

<p>Again Mr. Daisy winked. “Watch how she takes
it,” he instructed. “And then begin pullin’ a lotta
patter about what a pity it is—see—and what good
chances Mr. Daisy had right here on this ole
desert, but threw ’em all away because of a woman.”
Mr. Daisy winked once more. “Pull that on ’er,”
he added, “and then set on the lid and wait for
the cuckoo to come outa her clock. And if she
begins puttin’ on one o’ these I’m-to-blame performances,
you tell her you maybe could telephone to
Opaco in time to stop Mr. Daisy; and maybe he’d
come back in Santa Claus’ sleigh.”</p>

<p>“Why, I don’t know what you mean at all!”</p>

<p>Mr. Daisy scratched a pitcher-handle ear with
one finger, then jumped at the water cock, as his
tank was running over.</p>

<p>“I mean,” he told Manzanita, “that Mr. Daisy
might be persuaded to come back and begat a little
kick into a certain gypo outfit you an’ me know
about, ma’am.”</p>

<p>“And shall I telephone you?”</p>

<p>“Well—now—that won’t be hardly necessary,
ma’am—’cause I’m comin’ back, anyway. But all
the time I’m gone, you keep on pullin’ that what-a-pity
racket—see?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>“I’ll see what I can do,” promised Manzanita,
suppressing her laughter as she hurried toward the
corrals.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>For years a stage line had run between Opaco
and Piñon, seven thousand feet up in the mountains.
Piñon was the summer headquarters of the
Squawtooth outfit, and also a post-office point for
gold mining camps and a lumber mill farther back
in the wilderness. The stage carried mail, supplies,
and passengers; and often it brought out gold ingots
to be shipped to the mint in San Francisco.
Frequent washouts in the mountain roads and difficult
grades made an automobile impracticable, and
the company still adhered to the picturesque four-horse
mode of travel for the outland lap of the
trip. Now that the construction men had come
the stage had changed its route, making a wide detour
over the desert to include Ragtown, Stlingbloke,
and all the camps between the latter and
Squawtooth Ranch. Squawtooth had been a way
station since time immemorial. Where it ran only
once a week before the camps came, it now made
trips every other day.</p>

<p>Two passengers boarded the stage to-day at noon
as it pulled up, with a merry jingling of the bells
on the leaders’ hames, in the Mangan-Hatton camp.
One of them was Halfaman Daisy, the other Falcon
the Flunky. The two had arranged with a couple<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
of floaters passing through the line of camps to
hold down their respective jobs for a few days,
while they took a little vacation.</p>

<p>The stage took on the mail and two more
passengers and rolled away toward Squawtooth.</p>

<p>It was not yet one o’clock when it reached the
ranch, where Manzanita Canby came out with the
mail and an order for groceries from Opaco. As
she neared the stage one of the passengers leaned
out and bestowed upon her a prodigious wink.</p>

<p>“Why, Halfaman! Are you off so soon?”</p>

<p>He winked again. “Off so soon,” he told her.
“Any luck this mornin’, ma’am?”</p>

<p>“I made some progress, I think,” replied Little
Apple with a smile. Then her hazel eyes widened
a trifle as they sighted the passenger at Mr. Daisy’s
side.</p>

<p>“Why, are you going, too?” she asked Falcon
the Flunky.</p>

<p>“Yes, Halfaman and I are off for a little vacation,”
he told her. “All work and no play, you
know—the old excuse. We’ll be back in a few
days.”</p>

<p>There was time for no more, as the stage started
moving.</p>

<p>“I wonder what’s up,” thought Manzanita as she
walked back to her house. “The Falcon didn’t say
anything to me about leaving when he was over
here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>Five days passed; and in the meantime something
happened that caused a great deal of speculation
at Squawtooth and in the camps.</p>

<p>The third day after the departure of Daisy and
The Falcon the inbound stage, coming from the
mountains, was held up by two masked men who
wore overalls, and fifty pounds of gold bullion
was stolen. The driver, “Dal” Collins, had attempted
to draw his gun, and had been shot through
the abdomen. He was not expected to live. He
now lay at Squawtooth, nursed by Manzanita, and
under a doctor’s care. The sheriff was out with
a small posse, strengthened by Squawtooth Canby’s
cow-punchers, and they were searching the mountains
for the thieves.</p>

<p>Then early one afternoon “Crip” Richey rode
into Squawtooth from Piñon, corralled his tired
horse, and came into the adobe for lunch. He asked
to see the wounded man, and was permitted entrance
to the darkened room by the doctor. Manzanita,
hurrying to get the vaquero some lunch,
overheard the conversation.</p>

<p>“Well, Dal,” said Crip, after inquiring after the
sufferer’s progress toward recovery, “we found somethin’
that oughta cheer you up. We found where
them bandits had camped. The sheriff’s got measurements
o’ the footprints o’ both of ’em, too,
that he found where they pulled it off. Then we
saw the ashes o’ their fire where they’d camped,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
and some labels off o’ canned stuff. Right near
the ashes was a little crick that runs underground
pretty near altogether. But at that place you could
see down in where the water was, in a kind of a
little tunnel, all covered with ferns. It was pretty
near five feet down to the water, and we was wonderin’
how they reached it.</p>

<p>“So Lucky Gilfoyle lays flat down on his belly
and holds a match down in there, and he sees
a new can layin’ on the bottom, under the water.
They’d used that, and had thrown ’er in when
they broke camp.</p>

<p>“Well, we wasn’t goin’ to pay any attention to
it, but the sheriff wasn’t passin’ up chances. And
he gets down on his belly and strikes a match
and has a look.</p>

<p>“And he sees somethin’ pink, kinda, down in
there, but can’t make out just what she is. So
we cut a long pole with a crotch at the end of
’er and begins to fish. And pretty soon we fetch
up the can; and what d’ye suppose the stick had
caught on?”</p>

<p>There was a low mumble from the stage driver,
which the listening girl could not distinguish.</p>

<p>“A pink necktie,” said Crip. “She was tied to
the can. They didn’t have the savvy to cut a
pole, like we did, to reach down to the water; so
one of ’em had took off his necktie and fastened
the can on it. Then as the water had plumb ruined<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
her, he threw her in with the can when they was
ready to go. Did one of ’em wear a pink tie, Dal?”</p>

<p>Dal Collins mumbled something indistinguishable,
to which the vaquero replied:</p>

<p>“Can’t remember, eh? Well, it oughta be easy
to get ’em now. The sheriff’s sure, anyway, these
fellas come from some o’ the railroad camps. He
says these Jaspers, so far’s he’s seen, ain’t anything
but crooks, anyway. So if they come from
any o’ the outfits, or from Ragtown or Stlingbloke,
he’s got an idea that the tie was bought somewheres
here on the desert. All the big camps
sell shirts an’ ties and things like that in their
commissaries; and there’s little stores at Stlingbloke
and Ragtown. It was a new tie, you could see that.
Just wet. Not wadded much or dirty on the edges,
like an old tie’d be. The sheriff come down with
me. He’s gone over to begin ridin’ the camps now.
I come here for a feed, then I’m foggin’ it over
to Mangan-Hatton’s to go with ’im, if he finds
he wants me to.”</p>

<p>Here Squawtooth Canby came in and went on
into the sick room. For his benefit the story was
repeated by Crip.</p>

<p>Manzanita called Crip to lunch presently, and
when he was settled at the table she left the room,
much to the gentleman’s disgust, telling him to pound
on something with his fork if he required anything
more. In her own little room, which looked out on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
green alfalfa fields and the pear orchard, she sat
down to think.</p>

<p>She had seen Halfaman Daisy dressed up as he
went through on the stage to Opaco; and no one
who ever had seen Mr. Daisy dressed up could
forget the horror of the combination made by his
sandy hair and his new pink tie. Halfaman Daisy
and Falcon the Flunky were partners. They had
come to the desert together from some mysterious
place far beyond. Together they had left the desert,
five days before. Since their leaving the stage had
been robbed, and Dal Collins lay at the point of
death. A pink tie had been found in an underground
stream near where the holdup men had
camped.</p>

<p>Dully Manzanita thought of Hunter Mangan’s
serious words in regard to the flotsam and jetsam
of the railroad camps:</p>

<p>“There are many bright, capable men in trampdom—far
more than is realized by the general
public. But do you not see that this fact in itself
should make you cautious about picking a friend
from among them? Bright, capable men have taken
to tramp life, in many cases, because polite society
has for some reason ostracized them. They may be
bank defaulters, forgers, or even worse. Surely
your reason will tell you that no educated, refined
man need be a tramp laborer these days; and
that, since he is educated and refined, ambition<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
cannot be lacking. So such a man must be a
renegade, a fugitive from justice, an ostracized
member of good society, to explain his adherence to
the slip-along life of the construction stiff.”</p>

<p>There was a dull pain in her some place, she
could not tell just where, and her head ached, too.
What had Halfaman Daisy meant when he said he
might return in Santa Claus’ sleigh? He had
hinted at future affluence. And what kept the two
away so long? Also, why had not Falcon the
Flunky told her he was contemplating a trip away
from the desert?</p>

<p>He had not told her that the night he had been
at the house for supper, but she remembered that
he had told her other things—things to which she
had listened with long lashes hiding her eyes. No,
he had not said outright that he loved her more
than anything else on earth; but the tenderness in
his tones and the way he had looked at her told
her everything that she wished to know.</p>

<p>And now she realized that she loved him. Until
this cloud had settled over him she had not been
quite sure of the truth. Oh, why had she cultivated
his acquaintance so deliberately—to lead him along
half flirtatiously as she had done at first? Not for
long, though, she comforted herself. Quite soon
she had learned to like this quiet, unassuming young
man; and the more she had seen of him the better
she had liked him, until—this!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>Would he ever come back? How much depended
on that! Everything she told herself. If he did not
return with Halfaman they were guilty. Fifty
pounds of gold was worth approximately fourteen
thousand dollars. With this amount to divide between
them, why should they come back? Unless
it would be a crafty move to divert suspicion. One
moment Manzanita raged at Mr. Daisy for being
so stupid as to leave his pink tie in the water; the
next she was resolutely telling herself that a man
with eyes and voice and manners like The Falcon’s
could never commit a crime.</p>

<p>One thing certain, though: if they returned she
would at once speak to The Falcon on the subject
and demand the truth. If they did not return—she
could think no further. She did not wish to
think further along the line of this possibility.</p>

<p>She went about the ranch in sober mood all
that afternoon, attending to the wants of the stricken
stage driver and helping Mrs. Ehrhart. She was
dull, listless, and her head ached continuously—something
to which she was unaccustomed. Early
evening brought no less an important individual to
the ranch than Martin Canby, racing in from the
mountains on his snap-nosed bay, rapidly chewing
squawtooth for his kidneys and bursting with enthusiasm
over the man hunt.</p>

<p>“Hello, Pod!” Manzanita listlessly greeted him
as he watered his horse at the trough.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>“Where’s th’ sheriff, Nita?”</p>

<p>“Over at the camps, I think. Wipe the squawtooth
juice from your mouth and kiss me.”</p>

<p>“Ain’t got time, Nita,” he replied in a businesslike
tone. “We found the cover off a bunch o’
cigarette papers after the sheriff left. I got it.
There’s writin’ on it.”</p>

<p>“Let me see it.”</p>

<p>“Ain’t got time. A dep’ty says she’s mighty
important. Jest scribblin’, anyway. It don’t mean
nothin’ to them ner to me. But we’re hot on their
trail, and we found where this had been throwed
away. And the dep’ty wanted the sheriff to see it
’cause he might dedooce somethin’.”</p>

<p>“Deduce your grandmother! Everybody in the
mountains smokes cigarettes, and anybody might
write on the back of a book of cigarette papers in
an idle moment. Show it to me, <i>muchacho</i>!”</p>

<p>“Can’t, Nita. I gotta beat it. Wonder if this
here ole hoss is gonta drink the trough dry!”</p>

<p>“Please don’t say ‘this here old hoss,’ <i>hermano</i>.”</p>

<p>“This here hoss,” Mart corrected himself.</p>

<p>“I’ll allow that to stand if you’ll show me that
cover.”</p>

<p>But here Mart’s horse lifted his nose from the
water, and the young scout wheeled him.</p>

<p>“Mart!”</p>

<p>“Ain’t got time! The dep’ty told me not to show<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
the ev’dence to <i>anybody</i> but th’ sheriff. See you
to-night if——”</p>

<p>Two bounds and Manzanita grasped the mane
of the bay, just lifting his front legs to lunge
directly into a gallop. As he leaped the girl’s
right hand caught Mart’s sleeve, and with an agile
spring she landed astride, behind the saddle.</p>

<p>“Break away from me, will you, you little snipe!”
she mocked, as the pony sped away bearing both
of them.</p>

<p>“Aw, Little Apple! Slide off now; I’m busy!”</p>

<p>“You little podhead! Show me what you have,
or I’ll ride with you to the ends of the desert. You
can’t shake me, and you know it!”</p>

<p>She was hatless, and wore neither chaps nor riding
skirt. Mart glanced down at the generous display
of tight black stockings and jeered:</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I c’n shake you! You oughta be
ashamed—a big girl like you showin’ all them legs!”</p>

<p>“Only two, brother. But if you don’t wish to
disgrace me, come across with that cover. If you
don’t, I’ll ride with you right into the camps.”</p>

<p>“Yes you will!”</p>

<p>“I’ll show you. Come across!”</p>

<p>“Will you slide off and leave me be if I let you
have a look at ’er?”</p>

<p>“Uh-huh!”</p>

<p>“Cross yer heart!”</p>

<p>His sister agreed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>Mart took from a shirt pocket the dark-blue
back that had once held brown wheat-straw papers.</p>

<p>“Inside,” he directed.</p>

<p>She opened it as the bay galloped swiftly along,
and on the pink paper pasted there she read in
scrawly penciling:</p>

<p>“The sons also of Aaron; Nadab and Abihu,
Eleazar and Ithamar.”</p>

<p>For a moment the desert swam toward her,
yellow, suffocating. Then she said:</p>

<p>“Mart, I—I’m going to keep this.”</p>

<p>She was thrusting it into her pocket, but he
turned sharply and grasped at it.</p>

<p>“You’re crazy! Why——”</p>

<p>Unexpectedly she reached around his body and
grasped the saddle horn with her left hand. A
moment and she swung herself forward along the
bay’s side. She had felt his hands clutching at her
pocket as she threw herself from the speeding
pony’s back. She alighted safely in the sand, lost
her balance and pitched forward on her face.</p>

<p>“Hi-yi!” came Mart’s derisive shout; and like a
streak of brown the snip-nose dashed away at a
dead run.</p>

<p>Manzanita felt in her pocket. The pasteboard
cover had gone on with Martin.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII<br>

<small>BLACKY SILK</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">TWENTY minutes after Manzanita Canby had
struggled up from the sand into which her
leap from Mart’s pony had pitched her, she was
throwing the silver-mounted saddle on the back of
her pinto mare. She was chapped and spurred now
and ready for any meeting.</p>

<p>The fiery little mare leaped forward at the suggestion
of spurs about to touch her belly. They
dashed out of the gate and sped away over the
desert toward the railroad camps.</p>

<p>It was possible that Mart would not readily find
the sheriff to show him the pasteboard cover found
by the man hunters in the mountains. The sheriff
had been investigating in the various camps during
the greater part of the afternoon, and by this time—early
evening—he must have reached a point some
distance up the line. If only she could overtake
her brother and in some way manage to wheedle
him out of that damning bit of evidence against
Halfaman Daisy and Falcon the Flunky.</p>

<p>She had not stopped to reason. She knew now,
beyond all doubt, that she loved the flunky of
the Mangan-Hatton camp, and, womanlike, she cared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
not who knew it nor what any one might think.
Womanlike, also, she was riding now in unquestioning
devotion to protect the man she loved, be
he guilty or innocent. The makers of our laws
were perhaps wise when they decided it to be unjust
for a wife to be compelled to implicate her
husband. For if the wife loves the husband it
would require more than laws to make her condemn
him. Blind justice for men—blind love for
women!</p>

<p>On and on she rode, pulling up only when the
pinto raced alongside the work in the camp of
Jeddo the Crow, where Manzanita saw her black-haired
girl friend driving a wheeler team.</p>

<p>Wing o’ the Crow stopped her mules when she
saw her bearing down in a cloud of dust. With
her pony on her haunches, Manzanita leaned from
the saddle when she reached the railroad girl, and
asked excitedly:</p>

<p>“Has the sheriff been here, Wing-o?”</p>

<p>Startled black eyes looked up at her as she replied,
just above a whisper:</p>

<p>“Yes, why?”</p>

<p>“And my brother, Mart?”</p>

<p>“He rode in, lookin’ for the sheriff, Nita.
Wh-what’s wrong?”</p>

<p>“It’s about the—the holdup. Did the sheriff say
anything about a pink tie?”</p>

<p>Wing o’ the Crow’s eyes grew wider and more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
startled still. “He was carryin’ one—all in a string.
It—I know it——”</p>

<p>She came to a stop and bit her lips.</p>

<p>“I know, Wing-o; I know,” Manzanita said. “You
think perhaps it belonged to Halfaman, don’t you?
I—I’m afraid I think so, too. I’m riding now to
try and overtake Mart. There’s something else.
Mart has it. If I can get it away from him——”</p>

<p>Wing o’ the Crow was staring at her, her red
lips parted.</p>

<p>“Get it! Get it!” she cried. “If it’s bad for
Halfaman. Go on! You c’n tell me later. I c’n
wait. Halfaman never held up th’ stage. Him an’
your flunky.”</p>

<p>“My flunky! No—they didn’t. I know it. I
just know it! But even if they did——”</p>

<p>“That’s right. Even if they did! The sheriff
an’ your brother rode on up the line. You oughta
ketch th’ kid. Sheriff was here hours before. Cut
dust! I c’n wait.”</p>

<p>The pinto leaped forward again, and horse and
rider sped for the Mangan-Hatton camp.</p>

<p>Manzanita became tactful as she rode into the
bigger camp, though she slackened the mare’s speed
but little. The men had stared at her, and some
had yelled as she rode past the work. In camp
she found Hunt Mangan at the commissary door.</p>

<p>“I’m looking for Mart, Hunt,” she said lightly.
“Has he been here?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>“Why the great speed?”</p>

<p>“Oh, the mare’s been up for a day or two. She
feels good. Then I want Mart as quick as I can
find him.”</p>

<p>“Why, he was here a few minutes ago, looking
for the sheriff. He rode on up the line. Has
anything new developed in the man hunt? Mart
seemed in a hurry, and rode directly on when he
found the sheriff wasn’t here.”</p>

<p>“I—I don’t know,” faltered the girl. “You’ll
excuse my abruptness to-day. I want to find Mart.
Thanks for your help. Now I’ll hurry on.”</p>

<p>Hurry on she did, indeed, for the pinto was
covered with sweat and foam as they took the road
that followed the new grade at a run.</p>

<p>They neared the buttes. Mart had passed between
them, Manzanita knew, else she would have
seen him on the level desert across which she now
sped along.</p>

<p>Now and then she passed through groups of workmen,
who stared curiously at the foam-flecked mare
and her rider. Mart could not be so very far
ahead, she reasoned, for it was doubtful if he
had traveled as swiftly as she had after he had
shaken her off. Still, twenty minutes is a long
time in a matter of one rider overtaking another,
and the girl would not allow the tough little mare
to flag.</p>

<p>They passed between the buttes, and here for five<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
minutes she was held back by a shot that was
scheduled to be fired. There was but the one
shot, and as it detonated between the rocky walls
she lunged her mare past the astonished man who
had stopped her, and, with rocks and earth falling
about her, spurred on through the deep cut.</p>

<p>She made three more camps, each time to learn
that Mart had ridden on up the line only a few
minutes before her arrival. Yes, the sheriff had
ridden on ahead of him, hours before.</p>

<p>And so she came to Stlingbloke, with her faltering
mare about all in and her rider’s hope receding
with each new stopping point.</p>

<p>The ragtown was alight. It was growing dark
now. Piano music tinkled in the resorts. There
came the sounds of ribald laughter and dancing
feet. Stlingbloke was rousing itself from the afternoon
siesta.</p>

<p>In the street Manzanita accosted the first man
she met.</p>

<p>Yes, a man who said he was the sheriff had
been there that afternoon. The sheriff had been
riding alone. Her informer had seen nothing of a
boy on a bay horse looking for the sheriff.</p>

<p>“But there’s the sheriff now,” said the man,
pointing suddenly to a gray horse and rider just
jogging into town from the desert to the west.</p>

<p>Now the railroad grade ran almost due north
from Stlingbloke, and to have been at the camps<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
on up the line the sheriff should have come in
from the north; Manzanita wondered.</p>

<p>The sheriff saw her and rode toward her—a
big-mustached man with a small, wizened face,
seeming smaller still under the big Columbia-shape
Stetson that he wore.</p>

<p>“Ain’t you Miss Canby?” he asked, riding up.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Manzanita. “I know you, Mr.
Glenn. How do you do?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I been to Squawtooth several times. How’s
yer dad?”</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s just fine.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t he come up and help us hunt the
bandits?”</p>

<p>“He’s pretty busy just now. We’re doing some
building over at Little Woman, and he rides there
a great deal. That’s our winter camp, you know.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes. Quite a sight, these here camps.
First time I seen ’em. D’ye ride here often, Miss
Canby?” He was curiously eying her heaving mare.</p>

<p>“Not much. I’ve been here only once before,
in fact.” Then Manzanita made a plunge. “I’m
looking for my brother, Martin. Have you seen
him?”</p>

<p>“Left him up in the mountains. Did he come
down?”</p>

<p>“Yes, this afternoon. And you haven’t seen
him?”</p>

<p>“No. I rode on through here and to two camps<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
above, then cut west across the desert to a water
hole, where the second outfit gets water for their
stock. I was over there some time; then I cut
in straight for this place—made a triangle, see?”</p>

<p>“Have—have you found out anything? You see,
I know about the—the tie.”</p>

<p>Again he looked at her speculatively, and studied
the mare’s fatigued condition.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said slowly, “I ain’t got anything to
say, anyway, Miss Canby—if you’ll excuse me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s all right. I shouldn’t have let my
curiosity get the better of me. Well, I must ride
on and try to find Martin. We—we want him.”</p>

<p>“Tol’able het up—the mare.”</p>

<p>“Yes, she’s bound to go, and I thought I’d let
her work it off.”</p>

<p>“Uh-huh. Well, I’ll be peggin’ on, I guess. Ain’t
ye pretty far from home this time o’ night, Miss
Canby? Maybe ye’d better ride back with me.
I’m stayin’ at the next camp below here for to-night.”</p>

<p>He glanced around at Stlingbloke and several
curious observers standing in saloon doors.</p>

<p>“Course it ain’t any o’ my business,” he said
apologetically, “but ain’t you a bit worried, ’way
out here this time o’ day? ’S almost night.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll get along—thanks. I ride lots after
dark. I simply must find Mart. Don’t let me detain
you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>He touched a finger to the broad brim of his
hat, hitched up his heavy cartridge belt, and rode
on through town. Manzanita moved her pinto until
tents and sacks hid her from the retreating sheriff,
then sat her saddle a moment or two and heaved
a great sigh of relief.</p>

<p>For some reason obscure to her the sheriff, after
leaving the second camp beyond Stlingbloke, had
departed from the right of way and rode westward
across the sandy wastes. From the water hole he
had mentioned—she knew its location—he had ridden
back to the ragtown as the crow flies. Thus
she had come upon him before her brother had.
Mart probably was still trailing him. At the water
hole he doubtless would be told that the sheriff
had ridden straight to Stlingbloke, completing his
triangle, and Mart at once would continue on here
in his trailing. What luck! The sheriff was to
spend the night in the next camp below Stlingbloke—two
miles away, perhaps. There was no
course for her to pursue other than to remain
at the town to intercept her brother and in some
way rob him of the record of the family tree of
Aaron. For many men might wear pink ties, regardless
of the tastes of others, but who other than
Phinehas Daisy could have written his fantastic
rigmarole on that bit of pasteboard? And who
in the camps did not know that Mr. Daisy was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
proud member of the “begatters”—who did not
know that Daisy and The Falcon were friends?</p>

<p>She was at the edge of town farthest from the
retreating sheriff. He would not know that she had
not ridden on up the line. Her mare was spent,
anyway. She needed rest and water.</p>

<p>Manzanita dismounted and found a piece of lath,
with which she scraped the foamy sweat from the
pinto’s neck and rump and belly. This done, she
looked about for a means of at least letting her
wet her mouth, and caught sight of a tank wagon
in the rear of a big structure, half tent, half boards
and corrugated iron.</p>

<p>She saw nothing else that promised water, and,
though she dreaded to, she led the mare to the
tank.</p>

<p>A man stood in the rear door of the establishment
behind which the tank wagon was at rest. She
did not by any means like his looks.</p>

<p>“May I turn on a little water?” she asked. “My
mare needs it badly.”</p>

<p>At once the man became active. “Sure; sure!”
he said with a grin. “I’ll get you a bucket.”</p>

<p>She waited, the pinto pulling the reins and nosing
the spigot of the tank.</p>

<p>Directly the man came to her with a galvanized
pail. Behind him in the door more men now appeared,
and two women with impossibly pink and
white faces stood on tiptoe and watched over the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
men’s shoulders. From behind them came the
click of gambling devices and the wheezy complaint
of a piano.</p>

<p>The man who brought the bucket wore a black
Stetson hat, a cream-colored silk shirt without a
tie, and a fancy silk vest. Underneath the vest the
shirt bloused comfortably, cow-puncher fashion. He
was dark and had a carefully waxed black mustache.
His dark eyes seemed small and calculating—a
slight cast in one of them. Manzanita remembered
him now. He was the man who had watched
her so keenly on her first surreptitious visit to
Stlingbloke.</p>

<p>“Oh, thank you so much,” she said, trying to
keep the tremble out of her voice, for now she was
just a little bit afraid of this man’s steady stare.</p>

<p>She attempted to take the bucket. Their hands
touched.</p>

<p>“Le’ me draw the water,” he suggested.</p>

<p>“Just a little, please—not over two inches in
the bucket. More might hurt her, overheated as
she is.”</p>

<p>“Sure! I know. Just a little at first. More
pretty soon, maybe.”</p>

<p>He turned on the water, and the pinto frantically
nosed him aside to thrust her muzzle into the refreshing
downpour. Manzanita stood silent, ill at
ease, as the group in the door still gazed at her
and laughed occasionally among themselves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>“Where you from, kid?” asked the man.</p>

<p>The red mounted to Manzanita’s forehead in
resentment of the unwarranted familiarity. But
she thought it the part of wisdom to appear serene.</p>

<p>“I live at Squawtooth,” she replied. And she
added significantly: “My brother’s not far from
here. I’m waiting for him.”</p>

<p>“Who? The kid that rode through a little while
back?”</p>

<p>“Well, maybe he might be called a kid,” she
replied, “but he does a man’s work, and—and he
can throw a dollar in the air and hit it with a
six-gun. For that matter, I can, too,” she added.</p>

<p>“So? Nice little popgun you pack on your hip
there. Thirty-eight on a forty-five, ain’t she?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Huh! I usta take thirty-eights for pills when
I was feelin’ a little puny.”</p>

<p>“Indeed? Such pills are often good for certain
complaints—if they’re administered properly.”</p>

<p>He laughed. “Pretty good!”</p>

<p>“Thank you ever so much now,” said the girl.
“She mustn’t have any more at present. Now I’ll
ride around in front and wait for my brother.”</p>

<p>“Stick here five minutes and give the little mare
another drink.”</p>

<p>“No, thank you. I think that will be too soon.”</p>

<p>“I don’t.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>“Well, perhaps you don’t know her as well as I
do.”</p>

<p>“How ’bout yourself, then?”</p>

<p>“I don’t understand,” Manzanita answered, her lips
straight. She was reaching for the reins, which
he had taken when the mare forced her head into the
bucket, and now seemed loath to surrender.</p>

<p>“Why, you ain’t had a drink yourself.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care for any, thanks.” In truth her
throat was uncomfortably dry at that very moment.
“I’ll take the reins now, please. Thank you again.”</p>

<p>“Kinda anxious, ain’t you?”</p>

<p>She fought back her growing terror. “Perhaps
I am. I don’t want to risk missing my brother.”</p>

<p>“Nice little filly. Will she stand?”</p>

<p>“Certainly. But please—I must be going.”</p>

<p>Again she reached for the reins, which he held
just out of her grasp. She could not lay hold of
them without coming into close contact with him.</p>

<p>“We’ll leave her stand, and you ’n’ me’ll go
into Johnny’s place and have a glass o’ beer.”</p>

<p>“‘You ’n’ me’ will do nothing of the sort!” she
said hotly. “Will you please hand me those reins?”</p>

<p>She was trembling from head to foot now. From
the door she heard the sounds of tittering. Those
who occupied it were too far off to hear, but they
were able to interpret the meaning of her outstretched
hand and the immovable figure of the
man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>“What makes you so sore on me, kiddo?” he
asked. “Ain’t I treated you like a gentleman?”</p>

<p>“To a certain extent. You’re not doing so now,
though. Give me those reins!”</p>

<p>“Aw, come now! Forget the dignity stuff. I’ve
seen you before. You and your kid brother was
here one day, and the two o’ you was sneakin’
around, peepin’ into dance halls. I guess you was
interested, all right, but kinda shy about buttin’ in.
Well, there’s nothin’ to be afraid of. Come on in
with me. I’ll show you a good time. Ask any
of ’em if ‘Blacky’ Silk ain’t a perfect gentleman.”</p>

<p>“If you’re a gentleman you’ll hand me those
reins.”</p>

<p>“Aw, cut it out! You gi’me a pain! Come
on”—he dropped the reins to the ground—“you ’n’
me’s gota have a couple o’ beers and get acquainted.”</p>

<p>Shaking like a leaf, Manzanita took a step toward
the reins, trying to avoid him and at the
same time get hold of them.</p>

<p>He waited disarmingly until she stooped for
them, then suddenly took her by the shoulders.</p>

<p>With a little scream she straightened, but she
held the reins. Indignantly she shook her shoulders,
her tremor outmatched by her anger now. But he
tried to take her in his arms, grinning maliciously.</p>

<p>Then with all her might she shot a little brown
fist to his jaw, and it cracked musically. It was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
not a slap—it was a punch, deliberate and not ineffective.
In the instant that he was staggering
back, surprised beyond measure, she grasped the
saddle horn, and, without throwing the reins over
the mare’s neck and ignoring the stirrup, vaulted
like an acrobat to a sitting posture in the saddle.
When Blacky Silk stepped quickly toward her, his
dark eyes alight with anger and determination, he
stopped suddenly and looked into the black muzzle
of her Colt.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you feel like taking one of your pills
now,” she said, her voice cool and steady as the
whistle of a valley quail.</p>

<p>Blacky Silk seemed to feel better at once, though
his face did not show it. A laugh of derision came
from the door of Johnny’s place.</p>

<p>“Go on, Blacky!” they called jeeringly. “Ain’t
losin’ interest, are you? What’s the matter all of
a sudden?”</p>

<p>The muzzle of the gun was steady. The girl
held it on a line with her thigh, pointing straight
at his breast—not at his head, proving that she was
no amateur. Blacky seemed suddenly to have remembered
that when he took .38’s for pills it had
occurred in the day before high-power powder
had been invented.</p>

<p>“You made me,” she said. “I didn’t want to.
But now that you’ve started this thing, I’ll see
it all the way if you make another move toward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
me. I’m a woman, you must remember. A jury
couldn’t be got together that wouldn’t acquit me.
Think it over.”</p>

<p>Blacky did, then said huskily: “You win, I guess.”</p>

<p>“Then turn around and walk away from me.”</p>

<p>He obeyed her silently, and she touched the mare’s
ribs and rode swiftly away from the tank.</p>

<p>Roars of derision sounded behind her as the disappointed
Romeo returned to Johnny’s Place.</p>

<p>The triumphant but badly shaken girl reached
the street in front and rode before Stlingbloke’s
single store. There she dismounted and made a
purchase hurriedly, and, back in her saddle, she
engaged herself with it and the pencil she always
carried in her chaparajos.</p>

<p>She finished just as Mart came riding in from
the darkening desert on his snip-nosed bay.</p>

<p>Still pale from her recent experience, Manzanita
rode to meet him, calling:</p>

<p>“Mart! Mart!”</p>

<small>THE CHILDREN OF AMRAM</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">“NITA, what’n the mischief you doin’ here? And
it pretty near dark!”</p>

<p>Mart Canby, recognizing his sister’s voice, galloped
swiftly to meet her at the edge of Stlingbloke.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mart!” she cried in a low, tense tone. “I’ve
had a dreadful experience. Let’s get out of here.
Come on; I’ll tell you as we ride.”</p>

<p>“But I gotta find the sheriff,” persisted the messenger
with his old boy-on-the-burning-deck determination.</p>

<p>“He’s not here; come on. Please, Martie!”</p>

<p>They galloped down the now noisy street to
Stlingbloke, and took to the desert, which now
seemed more friendly than ever to the girl, who
loved it always.</p>

<p>“What was you doin’ there, Nita? That ain’t no
place for you. You was chasin’ me!”</p>

<p>“I know it. I admit it. I’ll tell you if you’ll
give me time.”</p>

<p>“Where you goin’? Don’t cut across the desert,
I gotta follow the grade. I missed the sheriff.
He——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>“I know. But he’s not at Stlingbloke. He rode
on through, on his way back. Maybe he has gone
back to Mangan-Hatton’s for to-night. You can find
him better to-morrow morning.”</p>

<p>Mart granted. “What’s the matter?” he asked.</p>

<p>When she told him he youthfully decided to turn
directly back and punish Blacky Silk, but the girl
pleaded with him to ride on. He was envious of
his sister in actually having had the experience of
“throwing down” on a man. Mart had packed a
six for three years, and had never had the opportunity
to throw down on anything more threatening
than a coyote. He agreed to spare Blacky
when she assured him that nothing serious had
occurred; then, manlike, he began to scold her
for getting herself into such a predicament.</p>

<p>Both talked at once on the various subjects uppermost
in their minds, and as Mart was hungry and
mannishly ill-humored accordingly, they verged upon
a quarrel.</p>

<p>“Why’d you tag me?” he burst out at last.</p>

<p>“Why did you treat me as you did, then?”</p>

<p>“Why’d you try to swipe the evidence?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t.”</p>

<p>“You did! You put ’er in er pocket!”</p>

<p>“I just wanted to examine it Mart.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t you? Course you did! You tried to
swipe ’er. I guess I could have you sent up for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
that. And I oughta do it, too, I guess. If you
wasn’t my own sister——”</p>

<p>“Fiddlesticks! I just wanted to see it. I didn’t
get to—good. Let me see it again, Mart.”</p>

<p>“Huh!”</p>

<p>“Please!”</p>

<p>“It’s too dark.”</p>

<p>“I’ll light a match.”</p>

<p>“What d’ye wants see it for, Nita? You gi’me
a pain!”</p>

<p>“I want to see if I can make out what the writing
means. I can’t even remember all of it.”</p>

<p>“None of us could. It’s loco.”</p>

<p>“Let me try to make out what it means, Mart.”</p>

<p>“And you rode all the way to Stlingbloke after
me just for that?”</p>

<p>“Uh-huh!” There was a caress in the female’s
tones now. Mart loved his sister. They always
had been pals. The carrying of the “ev’dence” to
the sheriff was probably the biggest event in Martin’s
life. Here was his old pal pleading to share
in his triumph.</p>

<p>“Will ye give ’er right back?”</p>

<p>“Uh-huh—course I will.”</p>

<p>“You ain’t got any match.”</p>

<p>“I have, too. I always carry matches.”</p>

<p>“Pa Squawtooth better not find it out.”</p>

<p>“He knows. Suppose something was to happen,
and I had to cook a jack rabbit on the desert to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
keep me from starving. Or get caught in front of
a forest fire and be obliged to back fire.”</p>

<p>“Well, you wanta keep ’em outa the stables,
anyway.”</p>

<p>“Of course. Are you going to show me the
cover, Martie? Please, now!”</p>

<p>“Here, then. Now don’t drop it, like you do
everything.”</p>

<p>As he passed it over something plunked lightly
in the sand between the ponies.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear! Wait! I—I did drop it, Mart!”</p>

<p>“Confound it! I knew you would!” Mart
reined in. “Don’t let your mare tromp it into the
sand now.”</p>

<p>They dismounted, lighted matches, and groped
about through the sand. The male was blusteringly
angry. Meekly the girl remained quiet under his
deluge of rebuke, seeming to sense for once her
many shortcomings.</p>

<p>“Please don’t scold, Martie!” she begged. “We’ll
find it.”</p>

<p>“Yes, we will—not! Now you’ve ruined everything!
Confound it, Nita, you’re always buttin’
in and puttin’ the kibosh on things!”</p>

<p>“I’m so sorry. I—surely we’ll find it.”</p>

<p>“If I do you’ll never see ’er ag’in; don’t ferget
that!”</p>

<p>“All right. Only don’t be mean.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” Mart sucked in his breath. “I got ’er!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
Almost hid in the sand. Now you keep yer nose
outa what don’t concern ye, will ye?”</p>

<p>“Ye-yes, brother.”</p>

<p>In outraged dignity the boy mounted, thrusting
into a pocket of his chaps the cover of the book
of cigarette papers his sister had bought at Stlingbloke,
and from which she had torn the contents.
In a pocket of her own chaps safely reposed the
“ev’dence.” Mart Canby had much to learn of
the wiles of the other sex, but it would have been
a difficult matter to convince him of this fact.</p>

<p>“We must be hurrying,” meekly said Manzanita.</p>

<p>“I wonder if the sheriff didn’t stop at that camp
over there for to-night.” Mart pointed through the
blackness to a cluster of lights on their left. “I
oughta follow the grade, Nita, and stop at every
camp.”</p>

<p>To his surprise his seemingly chastened sister
did not object now.</p>

<p>“Maybe you ought,” she replied. “It’s not a
great deal farther for us to go home that way.
If I go over with you, and he happens to be there,
will you promise to give it to him and hurry right
back to me? Pa’ll be worried about me if he got
home this evening.”</p>

<p>“Aw, worried nothin’! You been ridin’ the desert
nights ever since I c’n remember.”</p>

<p>“But there’s no moon to-night. And that business<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
at Stlingbloke has made me nervous. I want
to get home.”</p>

<p>“Well, come on, then.”</p>

<p>“Do you promise? Just give it to him, if
you find him in any of the camps, and don’t
wait to hear what he has to say. You’ll know
all about it later, anyway.”</p>

<p>“All right; come on.”</p>

<p>Mart found the sheriff smoking in the commissary
tent of the first camp out of Stlingbloke.
He handed the pasteboard cover to him and explained
how it had come into the possession of
the searching party in the mountains.</p>

<p>“There’s some funny writin’ in it,” he began.</p>

<p>But before he could get any farther his sister
called to him sharply from outside, and he remembered
his promise and reluctantly turned away
and joined her.</p>

<p>They set their ponies’ faces in a bee line for
Squawtooth and galloped away into the night.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>It was ten o’clock next morning when Manzanita
rode to see Wing o’ the Crow again. Mart had
resentfully returned to the mountains early that
morning, ordered to do so by his father. The
black-haired girl looked up with a question in her
large, luminous eyes as Manzanita reached her in
the borrow pit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>“I got it!” triumphantly announced the cowgirl,
alighting from her saddle.</p>

<p>Wing o’ the Crow took the pasteboard cover.
“Is that all it was?”</p>

<p>“Look inside.”</p>

<p>The gypo queen’s lips parted as she opened the
cover and read:</p>

<p>“The sons also of Aaron; Nadab and Abihu,
Eleazar and Ithamar.”</p>

<p>“He wrote that!” she said chokingly, looking up
with wide, scared eyes.</p>

<p>Manzanita told all about it then.</p>

<p>“Pa’s gone to Stlingbloke,” said Wing o’ the
Crow listlessly. “He’s all gowed up ag’in. I’m
runnin’ the outfit. Will be now fer a week, I
reckon. And I’m all wore out, too. Now this
has come!”</p>

<p>“Wing-o,” said Manzanita softly, “you love Halfaman
Daisy, don’t you?”</p>

<p>The gypo queen’s black eyes, suddenly afloat with
tears, looked unabashed into the hazel eyes of her
friend. “O’ course,” she answered simply. “And
you love his pardner, don’t you?”</p>

<p>Manzanita’s cheeks went crimson. “I—I think
so,” she made confession. “I can’t say it right out
like you do, Wing-o; but I want to protect him.
He didn’t steal that bullion.”</p>

<p>“He’s went away with Halfaman,” the other dully
pointed out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>“I know. But—but he just couldn’t do such a
thing. There’s some horrible mistake.”</p>

<p>“Wasn’t any mistake about that pink tie,” returned
Wing o’ the Crow. “Halfaman come sportin’ it
’round the first night he come to see me. Thought
it was the grandest thing, the poor nut! And
now that cover. Who else would write that foolishness
into a book o’ cigarette papers? Halfaman’s
wrote that all over the United States. He writes
it on everything, or something like it. It’s all the
Bible he ever read, and I reckon he’s proud o’
his education. He’s just a big-eared nut, that’s
all.”</p>

<p>“What shall we do, Wing-o?”</p>

<p>“Keep this hid, anyway, or burn it up. What’d
you write in the other cover that Mart give to the
sheriff?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I scarce know what I wrote, I was so
rattled at the time. I saw Mart riding in, and I
couldn’t think of anything but that fresh creature
that had been insulting me. He called himself
Blacky Silk. And I wrote that three times. But
really I wasn’t trying to implicate the fellow. I
was afraid I couldn’t get Mart away from the
sheriff before he’d told him there was writing on
the inside. And I was right about that. He did
tell him, in spite of me. So I just wrote ‘Blacky
Silk, Blacky Silk, Blacky Silk’ three times. I
couldn’t seem to think of anything else.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>“I guess you didn’t do so bad, after all,” said
the girl of the camps. “I’ve heard Blacky Silk’s
a bad actor.”</p>

<p>“What is he?”</p>

<p>“Gambler, I guess. He usta smuggle opium and
Chinamen into the States over the Mexican border,
they say. He did a stretch for it. I heard he was
in with the po-lice and slipped ’em somethin’.
They call it ‘Black Silk’ when a po-liceman gets
a drag from an opium runner or a chink runner.
That’s how come it he’s got that name.</p>

<p>“You couldn’t ’a’ done better,” she went on.
“I hate that fella. He follies the camps and robs
the stiffs and does anything mean. I wouldn’t care
if what you wrote was to send ’im up for life.”</p>

<p>“But really I didn’t mean to implicate him,
Wing-o. I—I was just all nerves, and so mad
and scared I could hardly think or see. And I
wrote the first thing that came into my mind, I
had to hurry so.”</p>

<p>“Don’t worry about that. Tell me if your Falcon
said anythin’ before he pulled out that made you
suspicious.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t even know he was going until I saw
him in the stage.”</p>

<p>“Same here with that cuckoo, Daisy. Funny!
Once Halfaman was braggin’ about what he was
gonta do one o’ these days. He said your Falcon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
was in on it. He was tryin’ to be mysterious. I
couldn’t get ’im. D’ye know anything about that?”</p>

<p>“No—nothing. Oh, I don’t know what to do or
think. I can’t believe either of them guilty—I
won’t believe The Falcon is!”</p>

<p>Wing o’ the Crow said nothing to this.</p>

<p>“What shall we do?” repeated Manzanita. “Oh,
I wish they’d come back!”</p>

<p>“We’ll jest lay low and keep our mouths shut,”
was the shanty queen’s decision. “If they do come
back we’ll find out all about it.”</p>

<p>Manzanita mounted to ride back to Squawtooth,
and her higher elevation in the saddle brought to
view a dust cloud hanging over the chaparral a
short distance away.</p>

<p>“What’s coming?” she asked, pointing.</p>

<p>Wing o’ the Crow climbed on her wheeler and
steadied herself by holding to the Johnson bar.</p>

<p>“Some kind of an outfit,” she answered. “Not
railroaders, I guess—all the outfits are in now,
except Demarest, Spruce &amp; Tillou’s. What’s
comin’ wouldn’t make a wart on their outfit. Desert
rats, maybe.”</p>

<p>Manzanita stayed her departure, and the two
girls waited and watched, for travelers on the desert
whose progress makes an appreciable dust cloud
always aroused curiosity.</p>

<p>It was evident that the moving outfit was of some
length, composed of a number of animals and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
vehicles. The desert wind was blowing, however,
and a haze of dust surrounded it, so that not until
the cavalcade left the main road and cut across
straight toward Jeddo’s did Wing o’ the Crow
recognize the foremost driver.</p>

<p>“Mercy!” she cried suddenly. “There’s the begatter
now!”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“Two skinners. The other’n must be your Falcon.
Yes—sure it is! Well, goodness me—what d’ye
know ’bout that!”</p>

<p>The small procession marched on over the sand
heaps and neared the borrow pit. The sagging grin
of Mr. Phinehas Daisy greeted them from behind
the team in the lead. Abreast of him another span
of strong mules drew up and came to rest, and
Falcon the Flunky was their driver. In all there
were ten teams of brown mules, young, thin-limbed,
well fed, and all wearing shining new harness. Behind
some of them trailed ten new number-two
wheelers, whose pans never had disturbed plowed
earth.</p>

<p>Mr. Daisy widened his grin and swept off his
broken-visored cap.</p>

<p>“Greetings, ladies!” he said. “How’s every inconsiderable
element this mornin’?”</p>

<p>The Falcon smiled gravely and lifted his hat.</p>

<p>“Where you been, Halfaman?” challenged Wing o’ the Crow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>“Shoppin’ for mules and harness and wheelers
and things. Cast yer black lamps over this here
display of railroad haberdashery, apple blossoms.
This here’s the new half of the Phinehas-Abishua
Construction Company. Where’s the dad?”</p>

<p>“At Stlingbloke.”</p>

<p>“Good night! Well, le’s unhitch ’em, ole Falcon.”</p>

<p>“Daisy, whose shave tails an’ wheelers are them?”</p>

<p>Mr. Daisy placed the tips of five fingers against
his breastbone and bowed till he was shaped like
a carpenter’s square.</p>

<p>“Mine,” he impressively proclaimed.</p>

<p>“Yours! Where’d ye get ’em?”</p>

<p>“Bought ’em.”</p>

<p>“With what, I’d like to know?”</p>

<p>“Money.”</p>

<p>Manzanita had been silent, watching Falcon the
Flunky out of the corners of her eyes. He was
chuckling audibly, apparently enjoying hugely the
coup of Mr. Daisy. It occurred to the girl that
he had refrained from speaking to her or to any one
because he did not wish to trespass upon what
seemed to be his partner’s great moment. Now
he looked straight at Manzanita and smiled at her
as he threw a set of creaking new harness from
the back of a mule. He looked like anything but
a man who knew himself to be guilty of highway
robbery. Wing o’ the Crow had turned to Manzanita,
and her look was one of significance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>“He—he’s tryin’ to horn in here with them teams
and tools,” she whispered. “That’s what he’s had
up his sleeve—what he was hintin’ at all along.
They’re—they’re dandy, ain’t they? My, we could
move dirt! But if he thinks he c’n win
me with mules and new harness he’s off his nut.
And he bought ’em with money, he said. Didja
hear ’im? Where’d he get money to buy that
bunch? There’s six thousan’ dollars’ worth o’
prop’ty there, if it’s worth a cent. And—lissen!”
She placed her red lips closer to Manzanita’s ear.
“Half o’ the gold that was swiped would be worth
somewhere between six and seven thousan’, they
said.”</p>

<p>Manzanita closed her eyes and nodded, her cheeks
a little whiter.</p>

<p>Mr. Daisy was walking toward them, leading a
bunch of mules, his big hand filled with tie ropes.</p>

<p>“Ladies,” he said with a sweeping bow, “let me
interdoose you to these here tassel tails. Miss
Canby, an’ Miss Wing o’ the Crow, this first bunch
here is the children o’ Amram—Aaron an’ Moses
an’ Miriam. The sons also of Aaron; Nadab and
Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar. They wasn’t named
when me ’n’ The Falcon bought ’em.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV<br>

<small>ESCAPE</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">AT seven o’clock in the evening on the day of
Mr. Daisy’s triumphal return, Manzanita sat
on the broad veranda of the old adobe at Squawtooth
Ranch. She and Mrs. Ehrhart were alone.
Supper was over, and the housekeeper had gone to
her own room. Manzanita’s father had been at
Little Woman Butte all day, and she did not expect
him home for the night. The patient had been
taken in the stage to a hospital on the other side
of the range—“the inside,” as the desert dwellers
called the peopled district between the mountains and
the coast.</p>

<p>Falcon the Flunky was coming to see her soon.
Any moment she expected to see his figure loom
up at the whitewashed gate that separated green
Squawtooth from the burning, barren desert beyond.
He had spoken to her a few moments that day in
the Jeddo borrow pit, after Mr. Daisy had inveigled
Wing o’ the Crow into a whispered conference. He
had asked to come. She was tense as she waited,
starting at every little night sound of the creatures
that inhabited the ranch.</p>

<p>The gate creaked suddenly. Some one was walking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
along the path toward the house. She rose
and stepped to the edge of the veranda, and the
new arrival saw the gleam of her white dress.</p>

<p>“That you, Nita?” came the question.</p>

<p>She sighed with disappointment. It was not Falcon
the Flunky, but one of her father’s vaqueros,
Splicer Kurtz.</p>

<p>“Yes. Hello, Splicer! What brings you out of
the mountains?”</p>

<p>“Sumpin. Got anything cold you could gi’me to
eat, Manzanita?”</p>

<p>“Sure; pie and milk and cold beefsteak. Or
I’ll cook you something. Are you afoot? I didn’t
know you could walk.”</p>

<p>The cow-puncher stepped on the veranda and
laughed. “Oh, I’m ridin’. I left my caballo out
on the desert, though, and walked in.”</p>

<p>“Why, what a silly thing to do!”</p>

<p>“Maybe; maybe. Just gi’me somethin’ cold—all
you c’n spare—and I’ll pack ’er away with me,
Nita.”</p>

<p>“You’ll do nothing of the kind! Come in and
put your big feet under the table, Splicer.”</p>

<p>“No, thank ye, Nita; I gotta be foggin’ it. You
see, I’m busy.”</p>

<p>“What’s up?”</p>

<p>“Oh, that holdup business. Gi’me all you can
rake up, Nita. They’s a bunch o’ the boys waitin’
for me out there. We’re all hungry.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>“Come in, then, while I get you something.
What’s—what’s new?” She found that her voice
was trembling.</p>

<p>“Well, I wouldn’t say. I oughtn’t to. Sheriff
said keep it quiet, you know.”</p>

<p>He followed her into the large kitchen, seating
himself awkwardly on the edge of a chair.</p>

<p>“When did you see the sheriff last?” she asked.</p>

<p>“This afternoon—late. He’s gone inside now.”</p>

<p>“He has? Why?”</p>

<p>“Well, I mustn’t tell, you know.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I forgot. His—the trip is connected with
the holdup, though, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“Maybe. Yes, it is—I c’n say that much. And
he left us boys to scout around over here. He
come up in the mountains this afternoon and said
for some of us to come down and keep our eyes
on certain parties while he went inside. He left
in an auto. We just got down. And I thought
maybe you could give us a bite.”</p>

<p>“Who-all are with you? Our boys?”</p>

<p>“Some of ’em. And the dep’ties. We’re through
up there. But don’t say a word. I’m tellin’ too
much now.”</p>

<p>“Don’t suppose you’d tell me who you are watching?”</p>

<p>“No, I couldn’t, Nita. Honest, I don’t like to.
You know how it is.”</p>

<p>There came a step on the veranda. Manzanita<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
darted to the door. Splicer had not heard, she
was almost sure. Her keener senses had been alert
for it. She stepped out on the veranda and closed
the door after her and stood facing the man who had
been about to knock.</p>

<p>“Listen, Falcon,” she said, grasping the lapel of
his coat before he even could offer her greeting.
“Go to the end of the veranda and sit down in
the shadow of the vines. Make as little noise as
possible. Go—I’ll explain later.”</p>

<p>She returned to the lighted kitchen after seeing
that her command was being obeyed.</p>

<p>Now, though her pumping of Splicer Kurtz was
skillful, she learned very little more from the
vaquero. She loaded his arms with paper sacks of
food, and he thanked her and took his leave. Then
Manzanita went out and into the shadow of the
vines that clambered over one end of the long
veranda.</p>

<p>“Well,” asked The Falcon, “what’s all this?”</p>

<p>“Come into the house now,” she said. “We—we
must come to an understanding.”</p>

<p>Silently he followed her, and they sought the
kitchen, which room was farthest of all from
Mrs. Ehrhart’s quarters. She seated him in one
of the straight-backed, thong-bottom chairs, and
for perhaps half an hour they talked of inconsequential
things, the girl watching the play of his
features all the time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>Then, when he least expected it, she rose suddenly,
confronted him, and silently handed him the
“ev’dence.”</p>

<p>He looked at it bewilderedly, turning it over and
over, then smiled up at her and shook his head.</p>

<p>“Open it!” she commanded.</p>

<p>He obeyed her, saw the writing, and held it
toward the miserable light of the kitchen coal-oil
lamp. He read aloud, then laughed.</p>

<p>“Daisy’s, of course,” he said. “And what shall
I say next? I seem to be sort of on the carpet,
am I not?”</p>

<p>“It was found up in the mountains some place,”
she told him, straight-lipped and watchful.</p>

<p>He lifted his brown eyebrows.</p>

<p>“Near a temporary camp, perhaps,” she added.</p>

<p>“Really, Manzanita——”</p>

<p>“And also close there somewhere they found
a pink tie in an underground creek. It was tied
to a can.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?” His expression suddenly had
changed; his eyes had narrowed.</p>

<p>“Who found it?” he asked.</p>

<p>“The sheriff’s men.”</p>

<p>“By George!” He slapped his thigh. Then he
turned brown eyes upon her and half rose from
his chair.</p>

<p>“I see; I see!” he said. “Heavens above! What
a mess! The holdup, eh?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>She closed her eyes and nodded slightly.</p>

<p>Then he rose altogether and stepped before her.
A moment he stood thus, while she looked fearlessly
up into his eyes.</p>

<p>“How does it come that you have this?” he asked
with a strange, new thrill in his tones.</p>

<p>“I stole it,” she told him naïvely, “from my kid
brother Mart, who was taking it to the sheriff.”</p>

<p>He reached out both hands and laid them on her
shoulders. “Why?” he asked, his tones husky with
eagerness.</p>

<p>Her long eyelashes shaded her eyes. The red
mounted to her cheeks. Falcon the Flunky waited
for no other answer, but folded her in his arms
and searched with his lips for hers. Again and
again he kissed her, his heart singing with gladness.</p>

<p>Then a step. The kitchen door opened. Squawtooth
Canby stood looking at them, slowly stroking
his patriarchal beard.</p>

<p>“Pa Squawtooth!” Manzanita’s eyes were tragic.</p>

<p>“Yes, daughter.” Canby stepped farther into the
room, his stern glance bent on The Falcon.</p>

<p>The younger man was now recovering from the
surprise. He smiled in his unobtrusive way and
stepped boldly to meet the cattleman, who remained
silent.</p>

<p>“Mr. Canby,” he said, “you surprised us. But
I’ll tell you now what I would have told you the
next time we met, anyway. I love Manzanita. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
think I’ve loved her since the first day I saw her.
I’ve just learned, through a rather peculiar happening,
that she loves me. She hasn’t even told me
so in words, but I know it’s true”—his brown eyes
shone with the lover’s triumph—“and—and—well,
that’s all, I guess. Except that, of course, I want
your consent to marry her.”</p>

<p>Like a storm brewing over the mountains evidences
of anger almost uncontrollable were growing
in Squawtooth’s eyes.</p>

<p>“Manzanita,” he said in a loud voice, “go to your
room!”</p>

<p>“Pa!”</p>

<p>“Go, I tell you! And you”—he took two quick
steps, and, before The Falcon knew what he was
about, had slapped his hips and coat to locate a
concealed revolver—“you,” he finished in a roar,
“are a prisoner! The nerve of ye!”</p>

<p>Manzanita stifled a scream with her hand across
her mouth. Falcon the Flunky backed away from
Squawtooth, his jaw dropping.</p>

<p>Canby laid a hand on the ivory butt of the heavy
Colt that was always at his hip.</p>

<p>“O’ course,” he said, “’twon’t be no use fer ye
to try startin’ anything. I’m gonta tie yer hands
an’ feet, an’ then ride over to the camps fer the
dep’ties. You here makin’ love to my daughter!
I oughta horsewhip ye!”</p>

<p>Falcon the Flunky’s face was twitching. “Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
Canby,” he said earnestly, “I’ll thank you to refrain
from such violent remarks until there has been a
little explanation. I——”</p>

<p>“I don’t wanta hear any explainin’. I guess a
thief always can explain some way. Manzanita!”
He flashed a quick glance at her. “You don’t
savvy, o’ course, or ye wouldn’t ’a’ acted like ye
did. This here’s one o’ the men that held up
the mail stage. T’other ’n’s this minute on his
way to the inside, with handcuffs on.”</p>

<p>“They’ve arrested Halfaman Daisy!” cried the
Falcon.</p>

<p>Squawtooth paid no attention to the interruption,
but continued to his daughter:</p>

<p>“I jest learned the latest pertickelers over to
Mangan-Hatton’s as I was ridin’ through. I already
knew about the tie, o’ course. The sheriff wasn’t
any too sure about anything when he left for the
inside. He’d gone up in the mountains to get the
boys to come down and take charge o’ things while
he was away. And when they got down here on
the desert this evenin’ they found that, while the
sheriff had been on his way up, these two bandits
had come in, bold as Cuffy, with six er seven thousan’
dollars’ worth o’ mules and new harness and
scrapers. The sheriff had gone and didn’t know
anything about it, so the head dep’ty took up this
Daisy at Jeddo’s camp where he saw that outfit,
an’ now they’re huntin’ fer this fella here. Word<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
come to-day that Dal Collins died in the hospital,
and our boys an’ the desert rats was gettin’ so mad
the dep’ties hadta rush that Daisy away in the
machine to save ’im.</p>

<p>“Now, I ain’t keen about lynchin’ a man myself.”
He turned back to the flunky. “But Dal was mighty
popular with the boys in this part o’ the country,
and they ain’t no tellin’ what they might do if
they got their hands on you two fellas. So best
thing you c’n do is le’ me tend to things and not
raise any rumpus. I’ll keep ye here an’ go tell
the dep’ties I got ye. They’ll sneak ye away to
Opaco somehow, ’thout lettin’ the desert folks know
ye’ve been caught. If I take ye to ’em, why,
my boys are there, and it wouldn’t be a nice sight—not
a nice sight at all. Suit ye to stay here while
I go tell ’em?”</p>

<p>“But, Pa!” from Manzanita.</p>

<p>“I told you once to go to your room, didn’t I?
I meant it. Ye ain’t gonta stick up fer this fella
after what I’ve jest told ye, are ye? Don’t be a
fool, Nita! I’ll fergive the rest ’o yer silliness
with this flunky.”</p>

<p>“You’re all wrong, wrong, wrong!” she cried with
a sob in her voice.</p>

<p>Canby shrugged and jerked his head toward the
door.</p>

<p>“But—but if he’s guilty, of course—of course——”
she faltered, her eyes fixed on The Falcon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>“O’ course he’s guilty. That’s the way to talk!
Now go. I’ll ’tend to the rest.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>With her ear to the keyhole of her door, Manzanita
stooped, her heart thumping throbbingly.
Sounds came dully from the distant kitchen, then
she heard the closing of the outside door.</p>

<p>She hurried to her window and listened, and
presently heard her father ride from the corral
on his big black saddle.</p>

<p>This was her signal to spring into rapid action,
and a moment later she ran into the kitchen. It
was empty of human occupancy. She jumped to the
pantry door and twisted the knob.</p>

<p>The door was locked and the key gone. She
placed her lips to the keyhole and called softly:</p>

<p>“Falcon, are you in there?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” came the answer.</p>

<p>“Listen! Listen!” she cried. “You must stay
there for the present. The key’s gone, and I’ll
have to break in the door. But I must get everything
ready first, or the noise will disturb Mrs.
Ehrhart. Are—are you tied?”</p>

<p>“Yes, hand and foot.”</p>

<p>“You’re not—not suffering?”</p>

<p>“Not at all.”</p>

<p>“Then be patient. I’ll let you out in a little while.”</p>

<p>The girl left the pantry door and began working
desperately now. She collected all the edibles she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
could lay hands on and a few utensils, then hurried
to her bedroom and slipped into chaps and shirt
and boots. She strapped on her Colt, and also
found a .25-.35-caliber rifle in a saddle scabbard.
Jerking two blankets from her bed, she hastened
with the collection back to the kitchen.</p>

<p>She grasped up all the articles then, and hurried
out into the night.</p>

<p>In the corral she caught her own mare and saddled
her, then essayed to catch another horse—the
only other one in the corral fit for the saddle—a
roan that Limpy Pardoe had broken only that
spring. Time and again the roan evaded her. At
last she got her rope from her saddle, and, though it
was dark, managed to cast the noose over his head
after many attempts, which took a great deal of
precious time.</p>

<p>Despite his protests, she saddled him, and, after
wrapping her collection of articles in the blankets
and tying them on behind, she led him and her
pinto to the kitchen door.</p>

<p>She was obliged to tie the roan, and this, too,
took time. Her heart was pounding now, for she
imagined she heard the rumble of hoofs.</p>

<p>After a desperate search she found the ax, hurried
in, and began belaboring the panels of the
pantry door. When they had given way before
her onslaught, she crawled through with the bread<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
knife and severed the rawhide lariat that held Falcon
the Flunky so helplessly on the floor.</p>

<p>With Manzanita dragging at him, they crawled
out just as Mrs. Ehrhart, in a long white nightdress,
appeared with a small glass bedroom lamp and
stood gazing with wide eyes.</p>

<p>“Get on the mare!” ordered Manzanita outside.</p>

<p>“I won’t run away,” The Falcon protested. “I’ll
face this thing. I’m innocent. I won’t desert Halfaman.”</p>

<p>“You must—now—for the present! They’re coming!
Get on! Later we can think. Now we must
get away. You must! To protect me, if for no
other reason.”</p>

<p>From the desert there came plainly now the
thunder of hoofs.</p>

<p>Manzanita’s last words decided Falcon the Flunky.</p>

<p>He mounted the mare. Manzanita untied the
roan, fought him a little to get the bridle reins
over his head, and, when she had accomplished this,
took the half-broken animal by surprise and vaulted
on his back.</p>

<p>Bucking fiendishly, he bore her away toward the
west line of the property, The Falcon following
and protesting that he ought to ride the bucker.</p>

<p>“Ride! Ride!” she shouted back. “This horse
couldn’t ditch me in twenty years—he’s an amateur.
Let her out! They’ll miss us in a minute now.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV<br>

<small>FLIGHT</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE rapid development of the unlooked-for situation
seemed to have bewildered Falcon the
Flunky. One moment he had been overjoyed at
the discovery that the girl he had loved almost from
the first day he met felt the same toward him,
that he had held her in his arms and kissed her.
Now they were fleeing from the hand of the law.
The biggest day of his life suddenly had been
turned into a nightmare of improbabilities, a whirlwind
of exotic happenings of which he had never
dreamed.</p>

<p>After a run of a mile or more, the roan colt
that Manzanita rode steadied down and ceased pitching
and plunging. The girl directed their route
of escape, leading the way over the illimitable sweep
of the desert by an unmarked course. Away on
their left blinked the lights of the camps, like great
ships seen at a distance on the sea. On their right
the mountains frowned down, black and mysterious
and forbidding in their world-old vigil over the
desert.</p>

<p>Since leaving Squawtooth the two riders had not
spoken. Whether or not they were being pursued<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
The Falcon could not tell, for Manzanita had not
stopped even to listen. She kept the steadying roan
to a swift gallop, swinging him from right to left
to avoid the clumps of desert growth. The pinto
mare followed him persistently. On and on into
the night they rode. Their quick progress made
conversation next to impossible.</p>

<p>They had been traveling two hours, perhaps, when
the girl reined in and The Falcon drew up at her
side.</p>

<p>“We’ll be obliged to let ’em blow,” she remarked.
“That clip would kill them before morning.”</p>

<p>They slowed to a brisk walk, and as the greasewood
was frugal here they kept side by side.</p>

<p>“Manzanita,” Falcon the Flunky said, “I don’t
know what to say or think. We shouldn’t have
fled this way. I——”</p>

<p>“We did exactly right,” she interposed. “I know
our boys and the desert rats generally about here.
Dal Collins, the stage driver, was an old-timer in
the country and liked by everybody who knew him.”</p>

<p>“But the deputies——”</p>

<p>“They would have been helpless. It would be
almost impossible for Pa Squawtooth to tell them
that he had imprisoned you without the desert folks
getting wind of it. They might have taken the
law into their own hands. Anyway, I was taking
no chances. This is safer.”</p>

<p>“But where are we going? What are we to do?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>“I know where to go to hide until we can think
the matter over and decide upon a plan of action.
I know where to go, all right. They’ll never
find us.”</p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p>“Up in the mountains. Mart and I found the
place. We’ve kept it a secret. We were going
to run away once, and we planned to hide there
till the hue and cry had died down. Then we
played outlaw there once. Weren’t we the silly
kids? That was years and years ago.”</p>

<p>“How many?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I won’t tell you!” she shot back. “It’s not fair
to ask.”</p>

<p>“But if Mart knows of this place, won’t he suspect
and lead them there?”</p>

<p>“That little rattle pod work against me, his old
pal! Not in a thousand years. He’ll be on our
side.”</p>

<p>“But Halfaman Daisy? Heavens, dear girl, I
never deserted a friend in my life! And Daisy has
been a good, true friend to me. Unselfish, cheerful,
loyal to the last drop of his blood. I——”</p>

<p>“You’re not deserting him, Falcon. Arrest won’t
hurt him. From what he’s told me from time to
time it will be no new experience. Not that he’s
bad at all, but—well, he’s been a tramp, and——”</p>

<p>“I understand all that. No, you bet he’s not
bad. He has a heart of gold.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>“He’ll be all right. They got him safely away
and started for the inside. When you and I clear
this thing up he’ll be none the worse for his experience.
You couldn’t help him, anyway.”</p>

<p>“But——”</p>

<p>“And you could not clear things up if they
lynched you, could you? And you couldn’t do
much if you were in jail with Halfaman, either.
No—freedom is best. Besides, it all made me mad
clear through. I don’t believe in meekness. I’d
rather take care of myself and fight ’em in the
open.”</p>

<p>“Our teams——”</p>

<p>“Our teams?”</p>

<p>“Well, Halfaman’s. What’s to become of them?”</p>

<p>“Are they at Jeddo’s still?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Was Halfaman there when he was arrested,
do you suppose?”</p>

<p>“I think so. I went over to the Mangan-Hatton
camp directly after you rode home to-day. I left
Halfaman there trying to convince Wing o’ the Crow
that he hadn’t stolen the outfit. I think he intended
to drive later to Stlingbloke and try to get Jeddo
the Crow to come back to camp and sober up.”</p>

<p>“Wing-o will take good care of the stock,” Manzanita
observed after a thoughtful pause. “Halfaman
would have had lots of time to explain everything<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
before they arrested him. He’ll have told
her what to do before they took him away.”</p>

<p>“But convincing her was one of Daisy’s problems.
He was worrying——”</p>

<p>“He needn’t have worried.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>Manzanita laughed. “Because Wing o’ the Crow
loves him,” she made answer.</p>

<p>“He’s not so sure about that.”</p>

<p>“I am, though. Rest assured she’ll aid and abet
her beloved Halfaman to the last atom of her
energy and devotion.”</p>

<p>“Do you know that?”</p>

<p>“Positively. She was helping me all she could
to keep from the sheriff’s hands the evidence against
you two.”</p>

<p>“The cover off the book of cigarette papers, I
suppose.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“You haven’t told me about that.”</p>

<p>Manzanita did tell him, then, to the last detail.</p>

<p>“And now we must go back,” was his decision
in the matter.</p>

<p>“You’re thinking of Blacky Silk, of course,” she
said.</p>

<p>“Certainly. What an odd thing for you to do,
dear. But also what a loyal thing.”</p>

<p>He rode closer, found her hand, and held it
until a large clump of greasewood forced their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
horses apart, and the combined length of their arms
could not bridge it. Manzanita laughed.</p>

<p>“Separated already!” she cried merrily, her bubbling
youth refusing to harbor downcast spirits in
the face of their predicament.</p>

<p>“Wing o’ the Crow says Blacky Silk is a villain,
anyway,” she complacently observed as they rode
together again, holding hands once more.</p>

<p>“That makes no difference. He’s innocent of
this——”</p>

<p>“How do you know that?”</p>

<p>“Well, so far as we know he’s innocent, at any
rate.”</p>

<p>“It seems that the sheriff didn’t arrest him,
anyway,” she added. “No, we’ll not worry about
Blacky Silk, Falcon. He owes me a little discomfort,
I think. We’ll not worry about anybody or
anything. We’ll just get clear of this vicinity for a
time, and give folks a chance to cool off. Meantime
we’ll look the situation over and find out how
best to prove your and Halfaman’s innocence.”</p>

<p>“Did you expect Blacky Silk to be arrested?”</p>

<p>“I did—afterward. But, really, when I wrote
his name on the cover I had no thought of making
trouble for him. I just knew something had to be
written there, and, as Mart was right upon me,
I scribbled what naturally was uppermost in my
mind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>“Yes,” she continued, “when Wing-o and I had
talked it over, I expected any minute to hear of
Blacky’s arrest. Then you two rambled in with
your mules and—well, spilled the beans, as they
say. I’m confident, though, that if the sheriff had
been there Halfaman would not now be under
arrest, and you and I would not be fleeing across
this old desert. I think the sheriff went inside on
some matter connected with Blacky Silk, whom my
scribble had caused him to suspect. Maybe he went
to try and find out more about the man. He told
the deputies to come down out of the mountains
and see that he did not get away, perhaps, while
he was on the inside. They came, and in the meantime
you fellows had shown up with your mules and
things. You two already were under suspicion because
of the pink necktie—and you being a man of
mystery, anyway, you know. So the deputies decided
that to arrest you two would be the proper
thing.</p>

<p>“And now,” she added, “I’m ready to hear what
you have to say on the subject.”</p>

<p>“You think me innocent, then?”</p>

<p>“Of course.”</p>

<p>He leaned toward her and put an arm about her.
Screened by the desert darkness, they kissed again.</p>

<p>“Despite the pink tie and the pasteboard cover?”
he asked softly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>“Despite everything. Please explain, though. I’m
merely curious—that’s all, d——”</p>

<p>“Say it,” he urged.</p>

<p>“Dearest!” she whispered, under the sheltering
blackness that hid her face.</p>

<p>“It’s all so simple,” he told her at last, “so ridiculously
simple. Long ago I promised Daisy that
I would help him any way I could, for I have
learned to love the heart of the man and to forget
his unlettered mind and lack of culture. It’s a
fellow’s heart that counts, after all. Culture and
education alone never could cause a friend to do
what he’s done for me. I could tell many stories
of his sacrifices for me when we were on the road
together. And once he saved my life on a fast
train at the risk of his own.</p>

<p>“I’d do anything for old Halfaman, and, as I
said, I made him that promise long ago. In his
crazy way he imagined that, to win the love of
Wing o’ the Crow, it was necessary for him to
impress her with his importance. It was his ambition
to get a string of good mules and tools and
go into partnership with her father—or both of
them—for Wing-o is half of the concern as it
stands. The best half at that, I imagine.</p>

<p>“So about all there is to the mule story is that
I promised to advance him the money to buy a
good outfit, taking a mortgage on them as a matter
of businesslike self-protection and allowing him to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
pay me back as the teams made money. Apparently
he had in secret talked the matter over with Jeddo
the Crow, and unbeknown to his daughter had been
offered a partnership if he could deliver the equipment.
So he put it up to me, and we decided
to spring a pleasant little surprise on Halfaman’s
sweetheart—and he at least was arrested for it.”</p>

<p>“What did the outfit cost?” asked Manzanita.</p>

<p>“All together, six thousand seven hundred dollars,”
he told her.</p>

<p>“You—you gave—loaned—advanced—Halfaman
Daisy six thousand seven hundred dollars!”</p>

<p>“Yes, dear.”</p>

<p>“Wh-where did <i>you</i> get the money?”</p>

<p>“From a Los Angeles bank.”</p>

<p>“But you’re only a—a flunky.”</p>

<p>He laughed gayly. “Yes, only a flunky,” he
said. “And a good one, too; ask the stiffs! You
see, the deal was to be kept a secret. Unless Daisy
lost control of his tongue, Wing-o was not to
learn right away where he got the funds to buy
the outfit. Now, though, I suppose, everything
will come out, and Falcon the Flunky will pass into
obscurity.</p>

<p>“But let me work up to that gradually. I must
explain about the tie and the pasteboard cover.</p>

<p>“We went inside to Los Angeles, then made it
by train to Sycamore Grove, directly opposite here
on the other side of the range, as you know. There<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
we got track of a bunch of mules that were on
pasture up in the mountains. From the description,
they seemed to be about what we were after. The
owner, however, was absent and the sale was in the
hands of a friend of his—with no commission
guaranteed him, I imagine. Anyway, he could
not, or would not, take us up into the mountains
to show us the stock. But he told us about where
we might find them, if we wanted to make the
trip ourselves.</p>

<p>“We had bought everything else in Los Angeles,
and ordered it shipped to Opaco by train. We
wanted the four mules that this man described.
So when we learned that they were on this side
of the range we decided to cross over from Sycamore
Grove, see the mules, take them if we liked
them, and come on down to the desert camps on
this side, settling with the owner later—and later,
also, go to Opaco for our shipment, having described
a complete circle in our travels.</p>

<p>“In an automobile stage we went up into the
mountains from the other side to a resort. There
we bought a few provisions, and, being old hobos,
did not require much of a camp outfit. We set
off afoot across the range to see the mules on this
side. We got lost, of course, and to this moment
have never set eyes on those four long ears. We
did camp several times, and almost froze in the
high altitude at night. Daisy did use his beautiful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
pink tie to haul up water from an underground
creek. But there seemed no other way to get at
it, and the tie was already wrinkled. For my
part, I didn’t miss it at all. As to the cover from
Halfaman’s book of cigarettes, I imagine he threw
it away at some time or other, the papers being
exhausted. But of course I can’t recall such a trivial
incident as that. The writing is his, though, and
I’m not surprised to see it where it is. If there’s
anything between here and northern California on
which he hasn’t written his begatting sentiments,
there was a great oversight somewhere.</p>

<p>“We had run out of grub, so gave up the hunt.
We knew where the desert was, of course, and
headed ourselves this way. Once down on the level
we caught an automobile bound for Opaco, and
decided to go on in and get our shipment, so as
not to fail in our proposed surprise and triumphal
entry for the benefit of Wing o’ the Crow. We
bargained for a ride, went to Opaco—passing directly
through Squawtooth, by the way—got our
outfit, drove out, and—bingo!—you know the rest.
At Opaco for the first time we heard of the robbery.”</p>

<p>“And is that positively all there is to it?”</p>

<p>“Positively all. Do you believe it?”</p>

<p>“Of course,” she told him simply.</p>

<p>“I’d rather have you say that than all the jurymen
and judges in the State,” he said. “I live on loyalty.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
It’s my religion. As Halfaman would say, you’ve
made an awful hit with me. And through all the
happy years that you and I are to spend together,
dear girl, I want loyalty to be our watchword. It’s
a beautiful thing—loyalty.”</p>

<p>“I guess the Canbys have their share of it,” she
said. “I’ve been told we carry it too far. But
we’ll take a chance. Loyalty begets loyalty sometimes.
It pays in the end. And now for the big
question and its answer. Then I have a confession
to make.”</p>

<p>“I’ve been occupying the floor for some time,”
he pointed out. “Suppose you confess first.”</p>

<p>She gave in, and told him of her father’s ambition
for her to marry Hunter Mangan, and how
she had revolted and planned to humiliate Mangan
and her father by making up to what she considered
the least important individual in the camp—the
flunky. How fate had taken the situation into her
own hands and caused her first to admire, then
come to love the man she had mischievously chosen
to bear the burden of her girlish willfulness.</p>

<p>Falcon the Flunky chuckled. “So your father
desires a moneyed man for you, does he? Well,
we’ll see what we can do for him. Disappointments
should be avoided in this life, if possible, you know.
He’s too old to face disappointments any longer.
I imagine he’s stood his share of them. I admire
your father. He’s so forceful and—and convincing.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
I doubt if any other man I ever met could tie me
hand and foot so easily. He has a convincing
way with that big gun of his. It’s folly to misinterpret
him.”</p>

<p>“He’s an old dear,” said Manzanita. “And as
for disappointment, he started out as a homesteader
at Squawtooth, with almost nothing for backing.
Disappointments! Goodness me! His life has been
one disappointment after another up until the last
ten years.”</p>

<p>“We’ll see if we can reward him for his patience
and perseverance,” said The Falcon with a merry
laugh.</p>

<p>“Now tell me,” she pleaded. “Don’t talk in riddles
any longer. You forced a serious confession
from me to-night. You’ve made me admit that I—that—that
you’re everything to me. And, merciful
heavens, I don’t even know your name!”</p>

<p>“I’ll keep you in ignorance no longer,” he
promised.</p>

<p>But before he could continue she laid her hand
on his wrist and whispered: “Listen!”</p>

<p>They reined in, every sense alert.</p>

<p>From a great distance came plainly the sounds
of galloping hoofs.</p>

<p>“Let ’em out again!” said the girl. “They’re
after us!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVI<br>

<small>THE RENDEZVOUS</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WHEN, after a long, steady gallop, the fugitives
rested their horses again, no unusual sounds
broke the eternal quietude of the desert night.</p>

<p>For a time they walked the animals again, and
then, at a late hour, the leader of the flight turned
sharply toward the mountains and continued in
their direction.</p>

<p>Foothills are little more than a figure of speech
as regards the mountain ranges of southern California;
for the mountains uprear themselves virtually
from level land with unexpected abruptness, and
there are scarcely any intermediate levels to render
an approach gradual. Before very long, then, the
night riders had left the desert below them and
were in such foothills as the range boasted; and
in less time still they were ascending sharply and
entering forests of piñon pine and mountain mahogany.
Still farther up they came upon a sprinkling
of pines and junipers, and before two hours had
passed found themselves in a black forest of
conifers.</p>

<p>“I can’t imagine how you know where you’re
going,” the man muttered to Manzanita.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>“I do, though,” she assured him. “There’s an
old, old road on our right now, which we have
crossed and recrossed several times to give us our
bearings. I’m keeping close to it and following
its general trend; but it would never do for us
to follow it directly. It’s almost overgrown with
brush. It ran to a gold mine worked by the
Spanish, perhaps fifty years ago.”</p>

<p>Many times they rested their tired horses during
the steep ascent. Signs of morning were in air
and sky when they topped the summit and crossed
a mountain meadow, lush with tall, cool grasses.
On the opposite side of the level valley Manzanita
plunged into the forest again. They rode for perhaps
half a mile, when she reined in and left the
saddle.</p>

<p>“This is as far as we go with the caballos,”
she announced. “We’ll hide the saddles and bridles
here, loose the broncs, and pack in to where we’re
going to hide. Two miles farther, perhaps. The
horses will head back for the meadow we crossed,
and the searchers will find them there, no doubt.
But that’ll tell ’em nothing. Whenever our horses
get away down at Squawtooth in summer they always
drift up here to the meadows. That’s why I
had you ride behind me after we left the desert.
One wandering horse usually trails another. Even
if they should find our horses’ tracks leading to the
meadow, they won’t know whether they were carrying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
riders or not. They’ll have a job to find out
just where we got out of the saddles.”</p>

<p>For a time she searched about in the blackness,
and presently called to him to bring the saddles to
her. When he had obeyed he found her standing
over a brush heap of dry black-oak boughs.</p>

<p>“Trimmings from black oaks our outfit cut for
fence posts,” she enlightened him. She held a
long pole, and now thrust it under the heap. “I’ll
pry up the whole pile with this,” she said. “You
cache the saddles way under, then I’ll let the pile
drop back over them.”</p>

<p>Soon they were away again, with packs on their
backs and the rifle, in its scabbard, swinging from
The Falcon’s shoulder.</p>

<p>It was growing light now. The eastern sky
was shell pink, and clouds were revealed.</p>

<p>“Those look like wind clouds,” said the girl reflectively.
“A big blow is about due. You’ve
never been in this country when the wind blows.
Say, you’ll remember it when it does! I hope one
is on the way. I could use a windstorm just now.”</p>

<p>They left little or no trail on the soft, slippery
carpet of pine needles. Through an unbroken
forest Manzanita led The Falcon, seeming to guide
herself by instinct, since to the latter one tree looked
as straight and unindividual as thousands of others
through which they had passed.</p>

<p>Then they began to ascend again, and the land<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
grew broken and rocky, with trees scattered about.
Soon, except for a sentinel pine here and there on a
rugged hillside, there were no trees; the ground was
covered by rocks and scattering chaparral. The
chaparral, about twelve feet in height and composed
of prickly buckthorn and southern manzanita,
grew continually denser, till at last they were confronted
by a solid wall of it seemingly impregnable.</p>

<p>“Now, if our Bible student, Halfaman Daisy, were
here,” said the girl, “the harrowing experience of
old Nebuchadnezzar probably would be recalled to
his mind. For, like Nebuchadnezzar, we’ve got to
crawl now.”</p>

<p>The Falcon watched with interest while she readjusted
her improvised pack. She lowered it from
between her shoulder blades to the small of her
back, then lay down flat on her face.</p>

<p>“‘Follow your leader!’” she quoted from the
old game and wriggled into the chaparral and disappeared.</p>

<p>Falcon the Flunky followed her example.</p>

<p>Under the chaparral tops it was black as ink
once more. The land was covered with a deep
carpet of the bushes’ tiny shattered leaves, and was
unobstructed save for the sturdy trunks of the
growth. Falcon the Flunky could hear the girl
wriggling over the cackling leaves ahead of him,
and set his course by the sounds. Now and then
he collided with a trunk, and now and then the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
prickly foliage, three feet above his head, raked off
his hat. Birds twittered and fluttered away, disturbed
from their nap just before the dawn.</p>

<p>Then of a sudden the crawlers came out in an
open space and lay panting. The sky had lighted
amazingly during their progress through the dark.
Manzanita lay flat, with her arms outstretched and
a smile of accomplishment on her young lips.</p>

<p>“Well,” she sighed at last, sitting erect and
picking the trash from her hair, “we’re here. And
they won’t find us in a thousand years. In these
mountains there are hundreds of chaparral patches
like this one, and no one ever thinks of crawling
into them. No sensible person, that is to say.
Mart and I do it, though. We’re always hunting
for hidden treasure, you know, old Spanish mines,
and skeletons and things like that.”</p>

<p>The Falcon looked about.</p>

<p>Great, gaunt gray rocks upreared themselves in
the middle of the opening, which was circular and
not over a hundred feet in diameter, with heavy
chaparral forming a dense wall on all sides.</p>

<p>“There’s water in those rocks,” she informed
him. “That’s how we might stay here forever,
if we had enough grub. Down below, on our
right as we came up, are a creek and sinegas; and
I presume the water here is a part of that same
system. But no one would suspect that there is
water here, in the heart of this thicket. Chaparral<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
won’t stand wet feet. Too much water kills it.
That accounts for the break here in the heart of the
patch. Mart and I are the sole discoverers, of
course. Now, any one trying to find us will know
that we must be near water in order to live. And
as chaparral is invariably on dry, poor soil, they’ll
never dream we could be in here, with water right
beside us.”</p>

<p>“How long do you propose to stay here, Manzanita?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know,” she replied lightly, rising
to her feet. “Till we can collect our wits, anyway.
I love this sort of thing. Mart and I’ve played
fugitive so much, but never before have I had
the chance to do anything of the kind for a really
truly reason.”</p>

<p>“You’re only an imaginative kid,” he sternly accused.
“What will your father think! He’ll be
distracted, dear.”</p>

<p>She remained thoughtful and silent for a time.</p>

<p>“He may worry,” she admitted at last. “But,
then, he brought it all on himself. The idea of his
forcing you with a six to be tied up! I don’t
know what’s getting to be the matter with pa here
of late—ever since I’ve been eighteen. If it hadn’t
been for me—oh, well, let’s not worry. I’ve been
thinking up all sorts of plans. If the wind gets
up we’ll communicate with pa or somebody before
very long. We’ll enter into negotiations with our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
enemies. If they’ll do so and so, we’ll do so and
so—and they’ll have to agree, ’cause we’ll have the
cinch on ’em from the start.</p>

<p>“Now, let’s stir our stumps and fix up our camp
over there in the rocks beside the water. Then
we’d better get some sleep if we can.”</p>

<p>They went into the outcropping of huge, gray
stones, some of them as high as twenty feet above
their heads, a grotesque assemblage that formed
an admirable shelter. From under one of them
water bubbled up, but seemed not to spread far over
the surface of the ground before the loose, gravelly
soil soaked it down again.</p>

<p>“Artesian,” observed The Falcon.</p>

<p>“I suppose so. It’s a freak outbreak, way up
here. Outlaws could hide here and defy a posse for
months, if their grub didn’t give out.”</p>

<p>With the small fencing hatchet that the girl carried
in a scabbard on her saddle The Falcon cut
chaparral limbs for their beds. On one side of a
large, pyramidlike rock in the center of the group
he made a bed for his companion, and laid down
his own on the other side. Then she “went into
her room,” as she expressed it, and stretched her
tired body on the boughs and a blanket.</p>

<p>Falcon the Flunky did likewise on his side. He
was far more tired than the girl, for, though a fairly
good rider, he was not hardened to the saddle as
was she.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>To state that he was worried would be putting
it lightly. What a chimerical idea it seemed; and,
still, when he reviewed the situation, he was obliged
to compliment Manzanita on her swift decision
and the practicality of her strategy. He did not
worry about his own predicament, but was thinking
of the wretched state of mind into which their
flight must have plunged Squawtooth Canby.</p>

<p>If he thought Falcon the Flunky to be a scoundrel—and
he could think little else from his viewpoint—what
tortures he must be suffering, when
he knew that his beloved daughter had escaped into
the mountains with such a man and was now at
that man’s mercy somewhere up there in the illimitable
fastness.</p>

<p>He could not sleep. Morning came fast now.
The sun was casting its dazzling rays on the tips
of the gaunt rocks above his head. Then came a
plaintive voice from the other side of the thick
partition.</p>

<p>“Falcon, I can’t sleep! My brain’s going like
a herd of longhorns milling.”</p>

<p>“Neither can I,” he told her. “Come around
and we’ll cook our breakfast; and then we’ll get
to our planning.”</p>

<p>“All right; I’m coming.”</p>

<small>THE SEARCH</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE face of Squawtooth Canby was drawn and
haggard as he rode his big black into the
Mangan-Hatton camp and dismounted before the
office tent.</p>

<p>“Tell Mr. Mangan I wanta see him, will ye?”
he asked plaintively of the assistant bookkeeper,
who just then appeared around the corner of the
tent.</p>

<p>“He’s up in the cut, Mr. Canby,” informed the
young man. “I’ll phone up for him.”</p>

<p>“Do that,” said Canby. “Tell ’im I’ll be ridin’
to meet ’im.”</p>

<p>He rode off toward the calico buttes, and soon
saw the contractor riding toward him from the
fifty-foot rock cut in the saddle.</p>

<p>Hunt Mangan’s face was serious, too, as he unsmilingly
rode up and gripped the cowman’s hand.</p>

<p>“You’ve heard about it, o’ course, Hunt?” Squawtooth
began.</p>

<p>“Yes,” Mangan replied.</p>

<p>“I’ve come to ask a favor of ye,” said Squawtooth.
“Me and my boys and the dep’ty sheriffs
was out all night scourin’ the desert, and even made
’er up into the mountains a ways. Ain’t seen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
hide ner hair of ’em, and ain’t even struck their
trail. The boys are restin’ up a bit at Squawtooth
now; but I can’t rest with her out there in
the wilderness somewhere, in that fella’s clutches.
There’ll be murder when I find ’em, Hunter. But
I come to ask ye if ye could le’ me have some men
to help run ’em down. That is, till we c’n get the
desert rats together and get at the business right.
I’ll pay the men their reg’lar wages, o’ course,
and’ll give the man that locates ’em five hundred
dollars to slip in his jeans. And, o’ course, I’ll
make it right with you, Hunt, for disturbin’ the
course o’ yer work.”</p>

<p>“It’s all made right with me this moment, Mr.
Canby,” Mangan feelingly told him. “I was going
to look you up and offer my services as soon as
I attended a pressing little matter up in the cut.
I’m sorry you were obliged to hunt me up.</p>

<p>“Now, I’m going to give you twenty-five men.
I’ve been looking into the matter, and can scout
up that many who claim they can ride. We haven’t
many saddles, and our stock’s not fast nor fit for
such work; but we’ll strap blankets and sacks on
some of our lightest mules and do the best we can.”</p>

<p>“I thank ye,” Squawtooth said simply. “I already
sent word up in the mountains for Martin
and Toddlebike to fetch down a string o’ hosses,
and they oughta get in some time late this afternoon.
We got a lot o’ saddles at the ranch, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
mighty few mounts this time o’ year. I’ve phoned
and sent messengers all over the desert hereabouts.
By evenin’ at the latest we oughta have a hundred
mounted men on their trail. What d’ye think o’
the proposition, anyway, Hunt? I’m plumb floored—can’t
think, it seems.”</p>

<p>The contractor was careful with his reply.</p>

<p>“My advice, Mr. Canby,” he said, “would be
for you not to take this matter too seriously. Your
daughter——”</p>

<p>“Not take ’em seriously! Why, man, ain’t my
only daughter—my poor, innocent, inexperienced
little child—out there somewhere with that ruffian!
Didn’t he coerce her into turnin’ him loose and
gettin’ horses and runnin’ away with him? Serious—why——”</p>

<p>“Just a moment,” interposed Mangan. “I am
positive that Falcon the Flunky is not a ruffian.”</p>

<p>“Why, you don’t even know his name, man!
Didn’t him and that big-eared Jasper with the chop-suey
face hold up the stage? And then spend the
money fer mules an’ tools, and have the nerve
to come right out here with ’em. Why——”</p>

<p>“Just a moment again, please. Doesn’t it strike
you that both Falcon the Flunky and Halfaman
Daisy are far too shrewd to do such a stupid thing
as you have suggested?</p>

<p>“Put yourself in their shoes, Mr. Canby. If
you had stolen fourteen thousand dollars’ worth of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
gold from the stage, and killed the driver, would
you buy mules and harness and wheelers and return
to your job on the desert? It strikes me as
a bit ridiculous.”</p>

<p>“Shrewd! Yes! That’s jest the point. Them
two knew they’d likely be caught on the inside.
A man with saddle-pocket ears like that fella
Daisy’s got couldn’t get away from the constable
down to Opaco. And <i>he</i> can’t stop a dog fight!
So they was jest clever enough to fog it right back
here; and they says to themselves: ‘We’ll go back
and go to work again, and nobody’ll ever suspicion
us then.’”</p>

<p>“And the mules and equipment?”</p>

<p>“Well”—Squawtooth grew hesitant—“they’d think
up some way to explain that. How did that
boy Daisy explain it, anyway? I never heard.”</p>

<p>“He said that Falcon the Flunky had loaned him
the money to buy them—six thousand seven hundred
dollars—and that he drew the amount from a
Los Angeles bank.”</p>

<p>“A likely yarn! A flunky drawin’ that amount
from the bank! And how ’bout the pink necktie?”</p>

<p>“Daisy admitted it to be his. Said he’d used
it as the finding of it indicated. Said he and The
Falcon had been in the mountains looking for
mules on pasture there, and had got lost and
eventually given up the search for them.”</p>

<p>“Oh, say! And you swallowed that, Hunt!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>“It’s as easily downed as the idea that those
two held up the stage, then deliberately came back
here to return to work—mules or no mules.”</p>

<p>“I can’t agree.”</p>

<p>“In defending this pair,” said Hunt Mangan,
“you may not know that I am passing up an
opportunity to further my own wishes, Mr. Canby.
But my sense of justice and the proportion of
things makes me say what I have said.”</p>

<p>“What d’ye mean by that?”</p>

<p>“If I could think Falcon the Flunky guilty—and
help to prove him guilty—I’m sure your daughter
would have nothing more to do with him. And
that is what I selfishly want. I love Manzanita,
Mr. Canby.”</p>

<p>The fierce blue eyes of Squawtooth filled unexpectedly.</p>

<p>“I know that, Hunt,” he said. “I—I’m glad.
She’s young and crazy with the heat—plumb loco!—that’s
all’s the matter with the girl. Lack o’ years
and experience. I’d like fer ye to marry her,
Hunt, once she gets outa this scrape. She’s just
a kid without a mother—she don’t savvy. But I’m
scared—Lord, I’m scared! That low-down c’y-ote
will——”</p>

<p>“Again I can’t agree,” Mangan stopped him.
“Mr. Canby, I’ve handled men as you’ve handled
cattle. I’ve employed hundreds and hundreds—no,
thousands and thousands. I’m naturally a pretty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
good judge of them. This Falcon the Flunky
is no reprobate, I’m positive.”</p>

<p>“What is he, then?”</p>

<p>“That I can’t say. I know no more about him
than you do—except instinctively.”</p>

<p>“But didn’t he run away with my girl?”</p>

<p>“I am inclined to the belief,” returned Mangan,
with a little smile, “that your girl ran away with
him.”</p>

<p>“She did, o’ course—seein’s she was outside the
closet and he was in it, tied. She deceived me,
Hunt. She made me think she was agin’ The
Falcon, and agreed to what I was goin’ to do.
Then I’m no more’n gone when—bingo!—she turns
’im loose, and together they fork saddles and fogs
it. She done it, o’ course, but he’d pulled the wool
over her eyes and made ’er.”</p>

<p>“I can’t blame him,” Hunt objected. “Things
looked a little hot when you and the deputies and
your vaqueros started for Squawtooth. I guess
I’d have hit the trail myself, under the circumstances.”</p>

<p>“Maybe; maybe. O’ course he’d protect ’imself,
guilty or not guilty. Well, we’ll get ’im and see,
anyway—that is, if the desert folks don’t get too
rambunctious and fix ’im so he can’t talk before
we get a chance at ’im. But, Hunter, this won’t
make any difference in yer feelin’s toward the girl,
will it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>“Not the slightest,” Mangan told him. “But
I’ve given up hope. Falcon the Flunky is her
choice, I know. She has decided.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, no! She’ll ferget all that.”</p>

<p>Mangan shook his head. “She’s a steadfast little
body,” he said. “Girls like her don’t forget—don’t
shift about in their affections from one to another.
She’s too simple—too sincere for that. No; I’m
out of it.”</p>

<p>Canby tried to encourage him, but he remained
firm in the belief that The Falcon had won Manzanita’s
affections. Squawtooth left him within
half an hour and went about his arrangements for
a big, concerted effort to hunt down the missing
couple. As yet no word had come from the sheriff
at the county seat, but it was known that Halfaman
Daisy had been safely lodged in the jail at Opaco,
awaiting the sheriff’s orders. By four o’clock
Mart and Toddlebike rode in from the mountains
with a string of saddle stock. By four-thirty the
hundred that Squawtooth had predicted would gather
were at the ranch, awaiting the signal to start.</p>

<p>Though little could be done during the remaining
daylight of that twenty-four hours, they moved
off soon and spread out fanwise over the desert,
searching for a trail or clews. They picked up
the trail that evening, and long before darkness
came had followed it for many miles.</p>

<p>Night overtook them, and they went into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
foothills to camp close to water. Next morning,
as early as they could see, they were away again.
They trailed the roan and the pinto mare into
the mountains, and eventually found the unsaddled
horses, still showing evidences of their hard trip,
in the meadow on the mountaintop. But here the
trail played out abruptly.</p>

<p>On every side of the meadow they searched
through the timber diligently, but found absolutely
nothing to signify which way the fugitives had gone
after deserting their horses.</p>

<p>Then at dusk some one turned over a pile of
brush and found the saddles.</p>

<p>It was too late to proceed farther that night,
so they repaired to a mountain lake to camp until
morning. Meantime, Indian trailers were on the
way to them from beyond Opaco—experts whom
the sheriff had often employed, sharp-eyed aborigines
who could detect signs of a person’s progress where
a white man would see nothing.</p>

<p>These arrived at dark. And in the event that
they should fail, Squawtooth had sent a messenger
to the resorts on the coast side of the mountains
to telephone the sheriff for the county bloodhounds—highly
bred dogs that had been known to pick
up a man’s trail twenty hours old.</p>

<p>But this night came the expected windstorm.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVIII<br>

<small>THE WINDSTORM</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IN the mountains the storm developed a stunning
downpour of rain such as only the West experiences.
Down on the desert there was no rain
whatever, but the wind blew with such terrific force
as to flatten many of the railroad camps, whirl
desert cabins around, carry away chimneys, and send
a sand storm raging over the level stretches which
was more than cruel to man and beast. Down
there men staggered around in the blackness, their
shelter swept from over their heads, their eyes and
teeth filled with sand—a scene of turmoil and intense
discomfort if not of actual suffering. Up in
the altitudes the search party was soaked to the
skin, their supplies were ruined, their stock stampeded,
and the rain eventually turned to a wet
snow, with the temperature lowering fast, while
always the terrific wind blew and swept all movable
obstacles before it. All traces of the fugitives’
flight would be wiped out. Neither Indians nor
keen-nosed bloodhounds would be of any avail
when the storm had passed. To search while it
raged was a hopeless task, if not impossible. The
telephone wires running out of the mountains were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
down, and so no word came from the sheriff after
he had started with the dogs. Squawtooth Canby
was the picture of discouragement.</p>

<p>And through it all, the only two in the entire
country who were not drenched and half frozen
or robbed of shelter and stung by particles of sand
were Manzanita and Falcon the Flunky, who sat
huddled comfortably in their blankets, under the
protection of an overhanging rock, and talked and
laughed and told each other how she or he had
felt when she or he first began to realize that life
would be a wretched drag of time without the
other’s love.</p>

<p>“Isn’t this just great!” shouted the girl above
the roar of the storm.</p>

<p>“Magnificent!” The Falcon shouted back.</p>

<p>“I hope no poor, unfortunate souls are out in
it!” cried Manzanita, as a flash of lightning played
over her radiant face.</p>

<p>“I hope so, too!” he yelled.</p>

<p>From time to time they dozed through the
night, and they had been able to sleep a little
during the afternoon before the storm swept down
upon them. They were as fresh as could be expected
when morning came, with the wind still blowing
a gale but no rain or snow falling.</p>

<p>Outside of their retreat the wind quickly cut the
snow as no sunshine would have done at that high
altitude. It remained between the rocks of their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
rendezvous, however, and the fugitives found difficulty
in getting rid of it. But they made snowballs
and rolled them about until they were of
gigantic proportion, then left them outside to be
whittled down by the wind at its leisure. Other
small snowballs were used for a different purpose;
and but for the fact that they dared not laugh
and shout they thoroughly enjoyed the pastime.</p>

<p>Inside the shelter of the rocks again, they built
a tiny fire on the stone floor of their half cave,
and cooked their breakfast. The fire soon dried the
inclosure, and as they were shut off from the
worst of the wind they were comfortable.</p>

<p>“Well, the rain and snow are over, thank goodness!”
said Little Apple. “But this wind probably
will blow for days. I’d like to see the camps
down on the desert. I’ll bet there’s not a tent
standing.</p>

<p>“Now, listen,” she broke off suddenly: “I’m going
to send Pa Squawtooth and Mart a message to-day.
They can answer with signals; and I know
where we can sneak out and get a glimpse of the
desert in order to see what they signal back. I have
my binoculars, thank goodness!”</p>

<p>“I can’t imagine how you expect to get messages
to them,” he said.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m going to show you in a little. There’ll
be some trifling risk in going out to send them,
but the chances are only one in a thousand that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
we’ll be caught. I wonder——” She came to a
pause and tilted back her head. “Say, maybe it’s
possible to see the desert from the top of one of
these tall rocks. They’re way higher than the
chaparral.”</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t the trees outside the chaparral obstruct
the view?”</p>

<p>“That depends. We’re on the peak of a hill,
you know. The trees not only are scattered in
our immediate vicinity, but they’re all much lower.
If only one of us could get up there and find out!”</p>

<p>They walked about looking up at the rocks, and
finally the girl discovered a jutting portion near
the top of one of them that she decided she could
rope. She had left none of her accessory equipment
with the saddles, so now she hurried between
the rocks and reappeared with a thirty-five-foot
plaited lariat of rawhide.</p>

<p>“Now, if I can get a lull in the wind! But
we’re pretty well sheltered.”</p>

<p>She widened the noose in the <i>hondo</i>, stood back,
and circled it about her head. The first cast she
missed, as the wind whipped the noose from the
target with a fretful <i>whang</i>. But when the rope
sang from her hand again the noose settled nicely
over the elevated protuberance, and she drew it taut.</p>

<p>“If you can’t climb it, I can,” she informed him
sweetly.</p>

<p>For answer The Falcon laid hands on the rawhide<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
and, with a vigorous boost from her, started
climbing, his knees working against the face of the
rock to aid him.</p>

<p>“You’re all right,” she applauded as he mounted
swiftly and dexterously. “The only fears I ever
entertained about you, Tom, were that you might
turn out to be a mamma’s boy. But you ride like
a saddle tramp and you climb beautifully.”</p>

<p>“Huh!” grunted The Falcon, as he reached the
noose and clambered to the summit of the rock.</p>

<p>He stood erect cautiously and looked away on
all sides, his feet planted and his body braced against
the wind.</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“I can see the desert,” he announced. “And up
here one is safe from being seen by anybody close
in the mountains. The slopes of the hill and the
forest around us and the chaparral make it impossible
for any one close at hand to see these
rocks. But if some one were stationed on a distant
peak, there might be a different story to tell.”</p>

<p>“I knew that—or suspected it. Don’t worry
about the peaks, though. The desert—can you
see Squawtooth?”</p>

<p>“I see a square of green.”</p>

<p>“That’s it. And the camps?”</p>

<p>“Can’t make them out. Say, I’ll have to sit
down, I guess. That wind could almost blow a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
fellow off of here. Can you tie your glasses to
that end of the rope? Then I can haul them up.”</p>

<p>She did this, and presently he hauled the binoculars
in and was training them on the desert, seven
thousand feet below.</p>

<p>“Say, the wind is tearing things up down there!”
he reported. “Worse than up here, I’d say.”</p>

<p>“Of course. Down there it has an unobstructed
sweep. It sucks down from the mountains. Stands
Squawtooth where it did, milord?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. But the camps! Say, tents are all
down and everything in a mess.”</p>

<p>“Is Stlingbloke any bloker?”</p>

<p>“I can’t see it. The buttes hide it. But Mangan-Hatton
is simply flat.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear!”</p>

<p>“And the sand is blowing over the dry lakes
till the clouds of it are sometimes so heavy I
can’t make anything out.”</p>

<p>“See any signs of a search party?”</p>

<p>“None at all.”</p>

<p>“Well, come down. If you can see the adobe
at Squawtooth, that’s all we care about. We’ll
make up signals for them to observe, and we’ll
tell ’em when to signal. Then you can climb up
where everything’s ready, and get what they have to
say through the glasses.”</p>

<p>Falcon the Flunky monkeyed down to her, hand
under hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>“We’ll not throw the noose off,” she stipulated.
“Now come in out of the wind, and we’ll write
our message to Pa Squawtooth and include a secret
one to Mr. Podhead Mart.”</p>

<p>“Are you a witch?” he asked, as he followed
her in among the rocks.</p>

<p>“Pa’d say, ‘Worse’n that.’” she retorted, tearing
and pressing flat a paper sack in which she had
brought some part of their pitiably small store
of provisions.</p>

<p>“Now,” she said, seating herself flat on the rough
stone floor and tucking her feet under her, “we’ll
get busy. You say that if you can get word to
a Mr. Winston in Los Angeles, you can clear
everything up, Tom?”</p>

<p>“I think so. Winston knows my signature, and
he knows me well enough to be positive that for me
to steal fourteen thousand dollars would be utterly
ridiculous.”</p>

<p>“Uh-huh. And he can get in touch with the
sheriff of this county and show him where he’s
barking up the wrong tree.”</p>

<p>“So I should imagine. Men listen to what a man
in Winston’s position has to say.”</p>

<p>“Uh-huh—of course. But listen here: There’s a
chance that we have been tracked to the mountains
and that Pa Squawtooth and a gang of men are
somewhere up here now, hunting for us. So if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
we send a message down to the desert, and pa
wasn’t there, it might fall into unfriendly hands.</p>

<p>“Say somebody else got it,” she continued to
speculate, “and decided to signal ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ or
whatever we may direct—and would fool us? If
Pa Squawtooth signals, ‘Yes—everything will be
all right if you come out,’ he will mean it, and we
can depend upon it and not be afraid to show ourselves.
But in case of his absence, somebody might
get our message and think it would be smart to
deceive us and get us out—when they’d nab us
and give us the ha-ha. See?”</p>

<p>“Yes, all that seems quite probable.”</p>

<p>“And at this distance the glass isn’t strong
enough for us to make sure that it is Pa Squawtooth
who is sending the signal, even though he
<i>were</i> sending it and was standing out in plain view.
You couldn’t be sure it was he, could you? It’s
more than twenty miles to Squawtooth.”</p>

<p>“Not with that sand storm blowing down there,”
he replied. “No; it would be difficult to tell one man
from another.”</p>

<p>“Uh-huh—so you see how easily we might be
trapped. But we’ll get around that, Tom—I always
did like that name!—and I’ll tell you how:</p>

<p>“You’ll write a message to Mr. Winston, asking
him to clear things up, and between the lines I’ll
slip in a message to Rattle-pod in invisible ink.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>“Say, sweetheart!” he cried. “Has this experience
gone to your head? Invisible ink! Why——”</p>

<p>“Oh, listen—listen, can’t you! If you knew how
many times Mart and I have played outlaw and
robber and sheriff’s posse and lost on a desert island
and games like that, you’d know I mean what I
say. But that was years and years ago,” she
quickly added, glancing at him furtively.</p>

<p>“How many?” he asked for the second time, with
an amused smile.</p>

<p>“None of your business, smarty! Anyway, it
wasn’t so long ago that Mart will have forgotten.
The minute he sees a message from me, with our
secret emblem in one corner, he’ll know there’s a
second message included in invisible ink. So we’ll
have him on our side; and no matter how they try
to fool us, we can get a true signal from the old
kid.”</p>

<p>“Go on; go on! I give up. If you’re ready, I’ll
throw things into the fire and say, ‘Double, double,
toil and trouble! Fire, burn and, caldron, bubble!’
and brew the magic ink. I sincerely hope the
doctors will pronounce your trouble of the harmless
variety, at least.”</p>

<p>“We have about a pint of invisible ink,” she
said primly.</p>

<p>“Certainly—certainly. Just keep quiet, now, and
don’t think about your troubles!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>“You’d better kiss me for that,” she suggested,
hiding her eyes with her long, chestnut lashes.</p>

<p>The Falcon paid the penalty of his levity with
good grace.</p>

<p>“Now I’ll write at the top of the paper with my
stub pencil, and explain what is to be done in
regard to the message you’ll write below to Mr.
Winston.”</p>

<p>“Proceed. Little matters like writing in invisible
ink and sending the messages for twenty miles are
nothing at all to you. I realize that fully. Go
on, wonder girl.”</p>

<p>“I don’t half mind your calling me names like
that,” she demurely informed him. “Well, here we
go to Pa Squawtooth.”</p>

<p>For a while she scribbled industriously, the paper
flattened against a stiff portion of her leather chaparajos,
often wetting the pencil at her adorable
lips, often gazing into space in search of inspiration.
The man watched her, and thrilled all over
again at the thought that she had given herself
into his keeping forever, come what might.</p>

<p>She finished and handed him her part of the message.</p>

<p>He read aloud:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Old Pa Squawtooth</span>: Forgive me, pa.
Forgive us. But one of us doesn’t want to be
lynched, and the other of us doesn’t want him to be.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
Pa, you’re all wrong. The sheriff is wrong. Everybody
in the world is wrong but Falcon the Flunky
and me.</p>

<p>“Now listen, pa: You’ll never, never find us. We
have provisions and guns to kill game with, and any
amount of water. I’ve known of the place where we
are hiding for two years, and I am the only one in
the country that does know it.”</p>
</div>

<p>“That’s a legitimate little fib,” Manzanita interrupted.
“Mart knows, but he won’t cheep.”</p>

<p>The Falcon continued:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Falcon the Flunky is absolutely innocent, and so
is Halfaman Daisy. The Falcon can prove that for
him to be connected with the holdup is an absurdity.
Below this note of mine you will find one from him,
to a Mr. Winston, in Los Angeles, chief engineer for
the Gold Belt Cut-off. Take it to him, and he will
confirm what The Falcon says.</p>

<p>“Then when you signal us that this has been done,
and that everything is all right again, we’ll come from
hiding. If everything is all right, hoist a red blanket
at noon to-morrow from the big cottonwood in the
corral at Squawtooth, and we’ll trust you and come
out. If that is too soon for you, make it next day at
noon, or the next. Every day at noon we’ll be watching.</p>

<p>“Show this letter to Mart, pa. Don’t fail to do
that, because we want him to ride to Opaco and see
Halfaman Daisy to tell him he won’t have to be in
jail long, and that his teams are probably all right.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
This is part and parcel of our conditions, this last.
You can cut the paper in two between my part and
Falcon the Flunky’s part and give my note to Mart.</p>

<p>“Don’t worry about me, pa, dear. I’m having a
perfectly lovely time, and I’m so happy. Love to
Mart and Mrs. Ehrhart and—I would fill the paper if
I were to continue, so hog the rest of it for yourself.</p>

<p class="right">Devotedly  <span class="gap">    <span class="smcap">Manzanita</span></span>.”</p>
</div>

<p>“All right?” she asked. “If so, write yours to
Mr. Winston beneath it.”</p>

<p>Accordingly, he took her stub pencil and wrote
the following, leaving an inch space between it and
her communication at her direction:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Charles E. Winston</span>, Chief Engineer’s Office,<br>
&#160; &#160; The Gold Belt Cut-off Bldg., Los Angeles, California.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Mr. Winston</span>: I find myself in a
rather difficult situation, and am writing this to ask
you to make an effort to set me straight, if you can
do so without telling all that you know about me.</p>

<p>Briefly, I am accused of highway robbery and
complicity in the killing of a gold messenger. The
sum stolen amounts to about fourteen thousand dollars.
I think this statement is sufficient for me to
count on your coöperation in clearing me. Hope to
see you soon. Cordially,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Falcon the Flunky</span>.</p>
</div>

<p>“Oh, you are going to sign that way!” cried the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
girl, when he had submitted his work for her approval.</p>

<p>“Yes—Winston knows what I am called out here.
He’ll understand. He’ll know that signature as
well as he would know my right one.”</p>

<p>“You know best about that,” she gave in.</p>

<p>Then in one corner of the paper she made a
tiny mark, which looked almost as if it had been
made accidentally, although it was distinct.</p>

<p>“When the <i>hermano</i> sees that,” she said, “he’ll
understand that the paper contains a secret message
from his old pal. Now, if only Pa Squawtooth will
cut our two communications apart and give mine
to Mart, as I directed! Everything depends on that—unless
we should be fortunate enough to have
the paper fall directly into the kid brother’s hands.
You see, my secret message will be written between
the lines of my part only. For, to bring the secret
message out, the paper must be heated. And, of
course, it wouldn’t do to heat the whole of it, for
then the invisible writing would appear on the part
that’s to go to Mr. Winston, and everybody would
see it. But if the kid can get away by himself

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIX<br>

<small>THE SORCERESS</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WITH the pines bending and groaning above
them, a group of men struggled against the
demoniacal onslaught of the wind to the top of a
peak that stood in the middle of Squawtooth Canby’s
mountain meadowlands. Over his shoulder one of
them carried a set of climbers, such as are used by
linemen to ascend telephone and telegraph poles.</p>

<p>On the summit of the peak stood a lofty pine,
alone and friendless and torn by the gale. At the
base of it the party halted, and as much as possible
sheltered themselves from the cutting blast.
The pole climber adjusted his spiked leg irons, and,
on the lee side of the old pine, began ascending.</p>

<p>“Now watch yerself, Pete!” he was cautioned
from below. “By golly, she’s a resky job!”</p>

<p>The man made no reply, but continued to ascend
rapidly, evincing confident familiarity with the climbers
that he wore. He was a Mangan-Hatton man
and was in charge of the electric-lighting system
of the camp. Wind and swaying altitudes held no
terrors for this old-time electrical man, familiar
with all branches of his work.</p>

<p>Before very long he was well-nigh to the top.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
Settling himself at last on a whipping limb, he
roped himself to the trunk of the tree, and then
unslung a telescope from his shoulder. At once
he deliberately began scouring the surrounding country,
swaying back and forth as the tree bent before
the wind and recovered its perpendicular stateliness.</p>

<p>A grand sight was revealed to the venturesome
climber. To the south and east and west swept
a magnificent forest of pines, tossing wildly like
waves at sea. Here and there a peak uprose,
snowcapped at its summit because of the recent
fall. In the background more majestic peaks upreared
themselves proudly, the summits of some
of them above the line of perpetual snow and always
white and glistening. To the west, seven thousand
feet below him, swept the beleaguered desert, over
which great sand waves rolled in tempestuous billows.</p>

<p>The watcher did not give lengthy attention to
the desert nor to the distant peaks, enticing as
was the view. Carefully he trained his spyglass
here and there over the lower mountain country
at his command.</p>

<p>He searched the lush meadows, where red cows
braved the wind and grazed and pastured horses
stood disconsolately, tail-on toward the tempest.
Then suddenly, about three miles distant, as he
judged, a man appeared on the top of a gigantic
rock that was thrust up above the foliage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>The spyglass steadied. The eye glued to it saw
the man stoop and haul up on a rope. Presently
he staggered before the wind, then sat down abruptly
on his perch and trained a pair of binoculars on
the desert.</p>

<p>For some little time the spyglass man watched
him. Frequently he saw his lips moving, so powerful
were his lenses, and saw him look downward
as if speaking to some one at the base of the rocky
monument. Then he crawled over the edge and
disappeared.</p>

<p>Studiously now the observer located lone trees
and other peculiar outcroppings of rock which might
serve in finding the eminence on which the wind-blown
figure had appeared. Then he took out a
pocket compass and lined the tree with The Falcon’s
rock. He reslung his glass and descended to solid
ground.</p>

<p>“I saw Falcon the Flunky,” he announced. Then
he sat down, with his back against the tree, and
in a notebook tried to map the country surrounding
the lookout post of the hiding couple.</p>

<p>This they took to Squawtooth Canby, in camp
below at the edge of the mountain meadow.</p>

<p>For many minutes the old cowman studied it,
while those in camp with him stood silent and
expectant.</p>

<p>“Just a leetle north o’ east, eh?” said Squawtooth
reflectively. “And about three miles from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
your tree, you say? Well, I dunno. Distances at
this altitude are mighty deceivin’—especially to a
man used to down below. Air’s light, ye know,
an’ funny that way. I’d say six mile, if you say
three.”</p>

<p>The electrician shrugged. This was out of his
line.</p>

<p>“They’s so many big rocks like that un croppin’
out that it don’t tell me anything. Still, we got the
direction. That’s a lot. Le’s throw the saddles on
’em, boys, and see what we c’n do in this hurricane.
I’d rather fight it on the move than stick
around, holdin’ to limbs and bushes to keep myself
from sailin’ down on the desert.”</p>

<p>Ten minutes afterward fifty mounted men, spread
out like a skirmish line, moved through the forest
toward the crow’s nest of Falcon the Flunky.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The two in their rocky rendezvous had just
completed their sixth set of communications, and
about all the paper had been used.</p>

<p>“Now for the secret messages to Mart,” said
the girl.</p>

<p>“I’m glad we’ve got around to that,” dryly remarked
The Falcon. “I’m growing the least bit
curious.”</p>

<p>“All right, Thomas. We’ll satisfy that curiosity
of yours. Please give me the fountain pen I see<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
sticking out of the slot in the bib of your beautiful
blue overalls.”</p>

<p>The Falcon handed her a handsome fountain
pen, heavy with chased gold.</p>

<p>She laughed as she examined it. “Didn’t your
brother stiffs wonder where you swiped this?” she
inquired.</p>

<p>“I almost never carried it in sight,” he explained.
“But I had taken it with me when Daisy and I
went to Los Angeles, of course, and had forgotten
to remove it when I went to see you at Squawtooth.
But for that I doubt if we’d have it with us now.
I assure you, however, it’s not a magic pen.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes it is! Watch it!”</p>

<p>She unscrewed the pen and deliberately poured
the ink on the ground. Then she went to the bubbling
water, stooping till the two long braids of
chestnut hair hanging forward over her shoulders
had to be tossed aside to keep them dry. She
thoroughly cleansed all parts of the pen, and held
it up in the wind to drain.</p>

<p>Next she picked up from their scant supplies a
can of evaporated milk, in the top of which two
holes had been punched. One hole she held directly
over the magazine of the pen. The white milk
spurted out and filled it.</p>

<p>She screwed the pen together once more, laid
one of the messages on her knee, and began to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
write between the lines of the portions written by
her in pencil.</p>

<p>“So young and sweet!” sighed The Falcon. “Isn’t
it a pity!”</p>

<p>“You think so?” She picked up a discarded
bit of paper and wrote something on it.</p>

<p>“Take this,” she commanded, and passed it to
him. “Hold it until it’s dry. Convince yourself
you can see no writing whatever. Then rake a
hot stone from the camp fire and slowly heat the
paper. I hope that will occupy you till I’ve finished.”</p>

<p>Falcon the Flunky carried out her instructions.
Before he began heating the paper he could see
only a faint glaze on its surface, which the casual
observer would not have noticed at all. Now he
pressed the paper to the hot stone, lifting it to
cool it when it threatened to char; and gradually
brown letters, clear and distinct, began to appear,
till finally he found himself confronted by this:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Falcon the Flunky needeth a shave.</p>
</div>

<p>“By George!” he exclaimed. “I never knew that!”</p>

<p>“You should carry a pocket mirror,” murmured
the girl, deep in her copying of the form letter
she had written in pencil.</p>

<p>She finished the sixth invisible communication.</p>

<p>“You haven’t read to me what you are writing
to Mart,” he pointed out.</p>

<p>She handed him the copy, and he read:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span></p>
<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Rattle-pod</span>: You can’t imagine the fun
we’re having. Too bad you are not in on it; but this
will give you the chance to get in, after a fashion.</p>

<p>Martie boy, The Falcon is as innocent of the holdup
as I am. I want you to believe it as I do, for <i>I know</i>.
We are afraid this letter may fall into the wrong
hands, and that a trap may be laid to lure us out
of hiding. So we’ll pay no attention to the red-blanket
signal from the big cottonwood at Squawtooth
unless we get another one from you at the
same time, assuring us that the other signal stands for
a genuine surrender. And your signal must be a
commonplace one, or some one may suspect. So if
everything is all O. K. for us to come out, get on
that gray colt you’ve been bragging you could break
all summer, and ride him out in the open to the east
of Squawtooth. I’m sure the colt will signal so we
shall understand. You’ll get the rest of the idea
from the penciled letters.</p>

<p>What I wrote about your going to see Halfaman
Daisy was written only to manufacture a reason for
the letter to be given to you.</p>

<p>Bet you my old spurs against fifty cents you pull
leather before the gray has carried you a hundred feet
from the corral. Lovingly,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="indentright2"><span class="smcap">Manzanita</span>.</span><br>
A Lady in Distress.<br>
<span class="indentright"><i>Go to it!</i></span></p>
</div>

<p>“So that will protect us,” said Manzanita, as
he laughingly returned the letter. “If we see a
gray colt go bucking over the desert when the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
blanket is hoisted, we’ll know everything’s all right.
Now—to send these messages down on the desert.
Get the rifle and come on.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Perhaps two hours later Manzanita and Falcon
the Flunky slipped into a grove of yucca palms,
tossing and singing in the wind that stood on the
edge of the desert. They had crawled from the
chaparral retreat, and by a circuitous, unmarked
route descended a slope of the mountains, over steep
slides and bushy expanses, to this vantage point.</p>

<p>“We won’t dare go a step farther,” objected the
man. “We don’t know who or how many may be
riding the desert in search of us. To walk out
there over the level, open land would be suicidal
to our plans.”</p>

<p>“Of course. We won’t have to. We’ll now scout
up the magic letter bearers, give them the messages,
and send them out over the desert to deliver them.
Come on back up the slope.”</p>

<p>He followed her. Soon she paused beside a
great, dry weed almost as high as her waist. The
drying by the fierce desert sun had caused the tips
of the branches to draw together so that the
branches were bowed and the entire plant almost
as round as a big ball.</p>

<p>“Allow me to introduce you to our first messenger,
Mr. Tumbleweed,” said the girl. “When he
has been uprooted, and a message tied to one of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
his branches, and we’ve pitched him up in the wind,
he’ll go racing across the sands as fast as some
horses can run. Have you never seen them? But
this is your first windstorm to experience in this
fair land. Well, cattle uproot them, I suppose,
and when the wind comes they go scooting over
the desert, rolling and bouncing ten feet into the
air at times, and often, when a gust gets under
them, they reach quite a height and sail through
the air in great shape. Fences catch them, and
Mart and I used to have to go get them out when
we were kids. Then at school here on the desert,
we kids used to play they were cows, and we’d
ride after ’em on broomsticks when they came
racing by at recess. But don’t ask me how many
years ago that was. Now up with this one!”</p>

<p>He laid hold of the dry, tough tumbleweed and
with an effort pulled it from the ground. The girl
had torn strips from a handkerchief which was
no concern of his, and with one of them she tied
a message to an inside branch of the weed, after
having wrapped the paper about the branch.</p>

<p>They collected three more, which were in like
manner intrusted with messages by the wind witch.
Then, with one in each hand—for they were as
large as tubs—they hurried back to the yucca grove.</p>

<p>“It’s too bad we don’t dare slip along under
cover till we’re abreast Squawtooth,” she complained.
“But the wind’s sort of blowing in that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
direction, as it is. These will go out over the
desert, and with folks hunting everywhere for us
some one surely will see one of the six messages
in one of our weeds.</p>

<p>“All right. Here we go! Say something mysterious
or uncanny—some sort of incantation. Anything—on
the spur of the moment, you know. I’m
going to throw it up. Shoot!”</p>

<p>“The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog!”
was The Falcon’s impromptu incantation as she
pitched the weed, and it sailed off exultingly on
the wings of the wind.</p>

<p>Away it sped, now and then striking the earth,
only to spring up as if it were on delicate springs
and soar for hundreds of feet again. Bounding,
rolling, caroming from hummock to hummock, it
raced away until it was only a tiny moving speck
in the distance.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll be jiggered!” muttered Falcon the
Flunky.</p>

<p>Manzanita tossed up another and another and the
fourth. After the first the three sped along as if
they were live things released from long imprisonment.</p>

<p>Three times more The Falcon was jiggered; then
they collected messengers for the two remaining
letters, and sent them out.</p>

<p>Now they began the steep climb back into the
mountains. Eventually they reached the top, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
had flattened themselves to crawl into the chaparral
when a voice was borne to them on the wind.</p>

<p>“Mercy!” cried Manzanita in low tones of consternation.
“They’re right on us. Crawl! Crawl!”</p>

<p>They did crawl desperately, and then came to a
stop when well hidden and lay without a move,
lest sounds of their progress be heard.</p>

<p>Now came a voice at the edge of the thicket.</p>

<p>“Could that rock be up there in the chaparral?” it
cried.</p>

<p>“Where’d they get water up in there?” came another
voice, from a little distance.</p>

<p>“Might sneak out and go down to that arroyo
for it. Give the arroyo the once-over for tracks.
Oughta be water there—I see ferns growin’. If
she’s moist, I’ll say comb the chaparral for ’em.
This is about the distance Squawtooth said the
rock might be from that pine back there.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XX<br>

<small>PREPARATIONS FOR NOON</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">A BIG black touring car covered with dust
purred into the village of Opaco. It had
come through the pass from the coast side of the
range, braving the rattling sand. Two men rode
in the car besides the driver. All three wore
goggles and had otherwise protected themselves from
the fierceness of the sand storm as much as possible.</p>

<p>The disguise, however, failed to hide the ruddy,
veined, and rather heavy face of one of the passengers,
a large, portly man in corduroy and puttees.</p>

<p>“Gone, by thunder!” he ejaculated as the machine
came to a stop before the little depot.</p>

<p>“You’re right,” agreed his fellow passenger.</p>

<p>The large man leaned from the tonneau and
aimed a thick white finger at a passing villager,
as if he were a living advertisement for the automatic
pistol which is aimed as easily as leveling
the index digit.</p>

<p>“You!” he bawled. “C’m’ ’ere!”</p>

<p>The long, lanky desert rat jumped as if the
street had grown suddenly hot under his big feet, and
promptly obeyed the authoritative command.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>“Has the Demarest, Spruce &amp; Tillou outfit
started over the desert in this infernal storm?”
the commanding person demanded.</p>

<p>“Ye-yes, sir. That is—er—they went before the
storm. They’re likely out there somewheres in ’er
now.”</p>

<p>“Oh! They couldn’t have reached their camp
site before the cursed thing slipped up on ’em,
then?”</p>

<p>“No, sir. They started day before yistiddy. The
storm, she broke last night. They couldn’t ’a’
made seventy mile before she come.”</p>

<p>“Thunderation! Didn’t any o’ you natives here
have sense enough to know it was comin’ and
warn ’em?”</p>

<p>“Oh, they was warned, mister. But the boss he
only laughed and said he’d been in blowin’ countries
before now. I’ll say if he ain’t, he’s——”</p>

<p>“Heavens! How’ll we get out to ’em?”</p>

<p>“Take that road there. Don’t ferget to fill
all yer water bags before ye start.”</p>

<p>“Anybody here in town who can go along and
show us the road? They tell me sand blows over
it and hides it sometimes. I can’t be bothered that
way. I want to make speed.”</p>

<p>The native scratched his head, unthinkingly loosening
his tightly crammed-down hat. He sprang into
the air and caught it with both hands as it started
for Nevada.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>“They was a fella in from the camps last night
said he’d like to get back,” he found voice to say.
“But he got in a poker game this mornin’ and
was holdin’ three kings when the stage got ready
to go. Guess he’d go along and keep ye straight.
That is, if they was anything in it. Ye see,
t’other fella he held three aces.”</p>

<p>“Trot ’im out here! Here’s a dollar for your
trouble.”</p>

<p>The villager disappeared with alacrity, and presently
the occupants of the automobile were confronted
by a slim man with black hair, a silk vest,
and a black, waxed mustache.</p>

<p>“What’s <i>your</i> name?”</p>

<p>“They call me Blacky Silk.”</p>

<p>“Uh! Thought I remembered that face. They
must o’ been watchin’ you pretty close in that poker
game. Twenty-five dollars of any particular interest
to you, Blacky?”</p>

<p>Blacky’s eyes widened. “I could place it maybe,”
he evaded.</p>

<p>“Then pile in here and guide us across this infernal
desert, if you know the way. Come on!
Come on! Don’t stand there twistin’ that French
chef’s can opener. I’m good for the cash.”</p>

<p>“I’ll say you are, Mr. Demarest,” said Blacky
drawlingly, and climbed in at the driver’s side.</p>

<p>“Bust ’er, Charlie!” ordered the red-faced man.
“Beat this wind or I’ll fire you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>“Yes, sir, bossman,” said Charlie, throwing in
the clutch.</p>

<p>“Shut up! Let your motor talk!”</p>

<p>The powerful machine leaped forward, kicked
dust in Opaco’s already dirty face, rumbled across
the bridge, and growled its way through the defile.
Then it raced out on the open desert, and the
wind shrieked with laughter over another victim.</p>

<p>“Great jumpin’ Jehoshaphat!” yelled Demarest into
the burning ear of his partner, Mr. Everett Spruce.</p>

<p>“What d’ye say?” bawled Spruce.</p>

<p>“I said—go to the devil; that’s what I said!”
And Demarest spit out a mouthful of sand and
tied his handkerchief over his nose. Spruce cupped
both hands about his mouth and placed his head
close to Demarest’s ear.</p>

<p>“I thought you said ‘liver and onions!’” he cried.
Viciously, Demarest dragged his hat down to
his ears, then released it, and through his hands
shouted back:</p>

<p>“You—are—an—ass!”</p>

<p>To which Spruce, who had not distinguished
a single word, nodded agreement and smiled complacently.</p>

<p>The wind roared and howled. The motor roared
back at it, and the nose of the steel monster plowed
on into the whirling waves of sand.</p>

<p>Toward noon the beleaguered motor party were
fighting their way up to an immense conglomeration<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>
of vehicles, teams, and men, the living components
of the mass drawn up in lee of the wagons, wheeled
into position to act as a barricade against the wind.
A sorrowful group they were indeed. Lips were
swelled to three times their natural thickness from
the sting of the alkali. Eyes were red and haggard.
The teams stood with their tails between their legs,
their rumps toward the wind, their heads lowered.</p>

<p>Now a second storm swooped down upon the
blockaded caravan in the form of Philip Demarest.
When every one was crestfallen and had not a
volley left to shout back at this Sheridan who had
raced to their revival, it was learned by the newcomers
that the tank wagons of the caravan were
well-nigh empty and that their commander had been
innocently waiting for the storm to subside before
attempting to move on to the next watering place.
To conclude, twenty minutes after Demarest had
ridden in the wagon train was once more fighting
its way through the sand storm toward water;
and now every man in the outfit had decided that
it was better to forge on than to be intrenched and
parleying with the relentless wind king.</p>

<p>Ahead of them the big car plowed on to reconnoiter.
The water was ten miles from where
the train had been halted, and Philip Demarest
knew that the fight to reach it would be a bitter
one. With all that they could take in the car
they drove back to the caravan, and desert bags<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
were replenished, thus saving what remained in the
tank wagons for the laboring stock. Skinners
walked so as to lighten loads to the last possible
ounce. Heads down, whipped nearly off their feet
occasionally, the thin-limbed mules moved slowly
along, mile at a time, the wagons sometimes almost
down to their hubs in the shifting sands.</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon the herculean task was accomplished.
Worn-out men and worn-out teams
rested once more, but this time at Dead Man’s
Wells, with ample water for all their needs. They
were still sixteen or seventeen miles from Squawtooth,
and Demarest decided to drive on there in
the car for the night and be ready to look over the
camp site next morning.</p>

<p>They were just about to start when their guide,
the estimable Blacky Silk, waiting beside the empty
car, saw a horseman riding toward him. He had
appeared miraculously, coming suddenly as he had
from a heavy cloud of blowing sand.</p>

<p>He made directly for the camp, and Blacky Silk
recognized him.</p>

<p>“Kid!” he called. “What th’ devil!”</p>

<p>The man saw him and swung his horse to the
lee side of the machine.</p>

<p>“Say, what you doin’ here?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“What you doin’ here?” retorted Blacky.</p>

<p>“I was tryin’ to get to Opaco to see you,” the
man replied. “Lord, I’m glad I drifted in here<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>
and found you! Save me over sixty miles o’ this.
Blacky, somethin’s happened.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>The man, “Kid” Strickland, from Stlingbloke, was
chunky of build and pockmarked, and showed small
evidences of being anything but an undesirable
citizen. He told of the arrest of Halfaman Daisy
and of the escape of Manzanita Canby and the
Mangan-Hatton flunky.</p>

<p>“I knew about that bird Halfaman,” said Blacky.
“I was at Opaco when they brought um in.
But——”</p>

<p>The other dismounted, and they held close consultation.
Presently Kid Strickland produced a
crumpled piece of paper sack, folded carefully.</p>

<p>“It was wrapped right around an inside branch
o’ that tumbleweed, I tell you,” he said forcibly.
“It blew right into me, and I was just gonta throw
it away and let the wind take it on when I see the
note. Then I got a horse and started to Opaco
to see you.”</p>

<p>“Good work!” was Blacky’s method of praising
him. “Noon to-morrow, eh—or next day, or next,”
he mused, after carefully reading the note again.
“There won’t be anybody about Squawtooth then, I
guess. They’ll all be out huntin’. I’ll say those
birds’ll get their signal, Kid—what?”</p>

<p>Kid Strickland grinned understandingly.</p>

<p>“Now here’s what we gotta do, Kid: This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>
note nor no part of it won’t go to this Winston
in Los Angeles, o’ course. Nobody else’ll see any
of it. We’ll just get word to the sheriff that we
know for sure these birds will be comin’ outa their
hidin’ place some time after noon to-morrow. And
tell um if he’ll stick around he c’n get ’em. We
can telephone and not let um know who’s talkin’—see?
There’s a phone at Squawtooth. Maybe,
while I’m there with the main squeeze, I’ll get a
chance at her. We’ll be there soon; I’ll try it.”</p>

<p>“That’s the dope, Blacky. The wind’s blowin’
straight from the mountains, so the tumbleweed
came from somewhere in that direction. I was just
this side o’ the buttes when she blew into me, goin’
to Stlingbloke. So when you get to Squawtooth
you c’n figger out about where they was in the
mountains when they sent her out. And you c’n
tell the sheriff, and have him be stickin’ around
there somewhere. Savvy the burro?”</p>

<p>“You bet yer sweet life! We’ll pin it on that
mysterious bird, all right. John Law is wise to
him, anyway, I guess. Well, here comes the
squeeze and the other two. We’ll be goin’ now.
Leave it to me. See you at Stlingbloke to-morrow
maybe.”</p>

<p>Blacky Silk tore the note into tiny bits and consigned
them to the winds, then climbed into the car.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The two lying prone on the ground in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
chaparral waited with bated breath for the verdict
of the man who was looking into the arroyo for
their footprints. They had not been down there, of
course, so he would find none. Still, signs of
water might lead to a search through the thicket,
in which case the fugitives’ camp surely would be
discovered.</p>

<p>“How ’bout it?” finally came the question from
the man who was close at hand.</p>

<p>“It’s moist, all right,” came on the wind. “No
tracks, though. Cows’ tracks here and there. Le’s
beat it up higher along the arroyo; there’d be water
higher up, I guess. Soaks in here.”</p>

<p>There came faint sounds of a horse moving at
a walk toward the last speaker, then all was still
once more but for the bluster of the angry wind.</p>

<p>Five minutes the hunted pair lay motionless;
then, as no more unusual sounds were heard, Manzanita
pulled The Falcon’s sleeve and crawled ahead
of him toward the rendezvous.</p>

<p>“That was a close call,” she said as they seated
themselves within the shelter of the rocks once
more. “Half a minute earlier we’d have been
caught in the open forest. They must have caught
sight of you on the rock, Tom, from what they
said. Close call, boy!”</p>

<p>She looked about her at the gaunt gray stones.</p>

<p>“The dear old things are like friends now,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>
and she smiled pensively. “My, isn’t it good to
be here, safe and hidden again!”</p>

<p>For more than an hour she remained apprehensive;
then, as nothing threatening occurred, her
heart lightened once more.</p>

<p>“They found no tracks, and have decided it would
be a waste of time to search this supposedly waterless
thicket. I guess we’re safe. We won’t have to
go out again, since we can see Squawtooth from
the top of this rock. Unless——”</p>

<p>She stopped and became thoughtful.</p>

<p>“Unless for some reason the signaling is delayed
down there and we have to go out and hunt for
something to eat,” he finished for her.</p>

<p>“That’s our difficulty. We couldn’t carry much
grub behind the saddles, and I hadn’t time to make
a sensible selection. There isn’t much, as you’ve
noticed. There’s quite a little bacon, but pitifully
little to go with it. There’s a whole pound of
coffee, and—and a few crackers, all chonked up
from rubbing against a saddle—part of a loaf
of bread; part of a can of milk; some salt. And
I guess we ate about everything else for breakfast.
You ate a terrible lot of bread, Tom.”</p>

<p>“I was hungry as a bear.”</p>

<p>“So was I,” she admitted. “We have plenty
of matches.” She brightened. “Well, we’ll not
borrow trouble,” she added after a pause. “If
the wind goes down and we dare sneak out, we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
can probably pot a jack with the .25-.35. To get
a buck, of course, would take a lot of hunting,
unless we were exceptionally fortunate. We couldn’t
risk that. There are gray squirrels down in the
pines, too; but if a fellow’s hungry, one doesn’t
seem overly large. We’ll see what we can do this
evening, though. That’s the time to get a chaparral
chicken, otherwise known as a burro’s cousin, or
a jackass rabbit.”</p>

<p>Young love knows not the drag of time. There
is so much to be told, so much to be planned, so
many assurances and reassurances of undying devotion
to be made, that the sun’s course from rim
to rim is all too speedily accomplished, and the light
of the stars and the smile of the moon must be
requisitioned to render one day long enough.</p>

<p>Almost before they knew it dusk was at hand;
then they remembered that now they were to make
an attempt to replenish the larder. Then, too,
they realized that the wind was abating.</p>

<p>Soon it blew only in occasional fierce gusts. The
tired trees ceased their groaning and tossing. With
sighs of relief the chaparral grew still. From a
fastness came the cool, sweet call of a mountain
quail.</p>

<p>The two slipped once more from the chaparral
and cautiously worked their way down toward the
desert. Just before dark they saw a big-eared jack
rabbit nibbling at dry grass behind a bunch of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>
squawtooth. Falcon the Flunky flattened himself,
took slow, careful aim with the .25-.35, and pressed
the trigger.</p>

<p>The larder had been replenished.</p>

<p>“You can shoot,” praised the girl as she picked
up the all but beheaded jack rabbit. “I like to see
’em killed like that—instantly. I can’t stand it to
see anything suffer. I was afraid you’d not have
the nerve to aim at his head.”</p>

<p>With their prize they hurried back to concealment.
Falcon the Flunky dressed the rabbit, and
they hung it up for the night.</p>

<p>For supper they ate bacon, and crackers dipped
in water and fried in the bacon grease. Then
they sat looking into their tiny camp fire and took
up their planning and assurances once again.</p>

<p>The stars came out, then the moon. All about
them the forest was mysteriously silent, save for
the occasional low roar of a bull bat swooping
down upon some luckless insect, or the distant questioning
of an owl.</p>

<p>“To-morrow at noon,” breathed Manzanita,
“everything will be cleared up. Then out we’ll go
to dear old Pa Squawtooth and tell him everything.
And then——”</p>

<p>“Then there’s going to be a wedding,” said the
man called Tom.</p>

<p>From close at hand came a fiendish laugh—ribald,
mocking, insane.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>“Only a coyote,” said Manzanita. “But wasn’t
it funny that he laughed just when you said that.
Do you believe in omens, Tom? Don’t ever, ever
again become implicated in highway robbery unless
you have a safety razor in your pocket, Tom!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXI<br>

<small>THE SIGNAL</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">A WEARY party of horsemen rode from the
mountains toward Squawtooth about eleven
o’clock the following morning. Squawtooth Canby,
a despairing man, rode in the lead, with his son
Martin at his side.</p>

<p>The dogs had failed to arrive because of the
storm, and doubtless would have proved useless anyway.
Because of the storm, too, the Indian trailers
had failed; for the wind had scattered pine needles
and leaves and flattened dry grass until the slightest
evidences of the fugitives’ flight had been obliterated.
The missing pinto mare and the roan colt,
together with their saddles and bridles, were all
that the search party had found.</p>

<p>“Ain’t that there a machine, son?” asked Squawtooth,
pointing ahead as they neared the ranch.</p>

<p>“Maybe the sheriff’s there, pa,” Mart suggested
by way of a reply.</p>

<p>“There’s another one,” added Squawtooth presently
as a slight change of course showed the rear
wheels of a second car beside the first.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ehrhart met the returning men, a question
in her eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>“Nothin’, Mrs. Ehrhart,” Squawtooth answered
it shortly. “We’re here for a bite, then we’ll get
out ag’in. Rain in the mountains ruined pretty
near all our grub. The boys’ll be in when they’ve
’tended to the stock. Just throw together what ye
can find. Mart’ll help ye. Who’s here in the machines?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Ehrhart wiped her eyes with her blue-and-white
checked apron. “One of ’em’s the sheriff’s,”
she said. “And Mr. Demarest come in the big one.
He’s here now. His outfit went through this
mornin’.”</p>

<p>“Thought I saw somethin’ new movin’ up through
the buttes. Martie, you get cleaned up and help
Mrs. Ehrhart to feed the boys. I’ll have to go and
see Mr. Demarest and the sheriff.”</p>

<p>He found Demarest, Spruce, and the wizened Fred
Glenn, sheriff of the county, in the parlor of the
old adobe.</p>

<p>Philip Demarest rose hastily and stepped to meet
the cowman when he saw him entering.</p>

<p>“Canby, by George, it’s good to see you again,
even if we find you in trouble. What an infernal
mess! Heavens to Betsy! Any news at all?”</p>

<p>Squawtooth Canby gripped the main contractor’s
hand and fought hard to appear cheerful and hospitable.
He was introduced to Mr. Everett Spruce.
He nodded briefly at the sheriff.</p>

<p>“Now, don’t pay any attention to Spruce and me,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
Canby,” urged Demarest. “We would have gone
on, but your housekeeper said you’d likely be in
soon. So we stayed to find out if there was any
good news to report or if we could be of any
help. We’ve a bunch of men and animals and
supplies to put at your disposal. Just say the
word, Canby. There, there, now! Cheer up; everything’ll
come out all right. It always does. I’ll
personally help you hang that upstart of a pot-walloper
when we get him. I’ll put the noose
around his infernal neck, and you pull the rope,
and I’ll kick the son of a gun as he’s goin’ up!
Now have your conference with the sheriff—we’ll
wait and talk everything over afterward.”</p>

<p>“I thank ye kindly,” said Squawtooth, and motioned
the sheriff to follow him to the veranda.</p>

<p>“Well, Fred, ye didn’t get up to us,” he began
as they seated themselves.</p>

<p>“It snowed like the mischief on the other side o’
the range,” the sheriff explained. “’Twouldn’t ’a’
been so bad, maybe, if the wind hadn’t blowed all
the snow into the gaps in the road. We was in a
car with the pups an’ got stalled, o’ course. Hadta
go back. Meant to put the pups on the train and
bring ’em through the pass to the desert side; but
we like to never made it back to Sycamore Grove
even. Didn’t till late this mornin’.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I knew how the gaps would be, once she
begun to snow,” Squawtooth exonerated him.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>
“Dogs wouldn’t been no good, anyway, once the
storm set in. Did ye take Halfaman Daisy to the
county seat?”</p>

<p>The sheriff scraped his feet. “No,” he replied,
seeming to the other to be a bit uneasy. “He’s still
in the lockup at Opaco. Funny business!”</p>

<p>“What d’ye mean?”</p>

<p>“Him bein’ pinched and all. I had a talk with
’im comin’ through. He said he’d just as soon
stay locked up a little while longer, if it would do
any good.”</p>

<p>“What d’ye mean?”</p>

<p>“Well, I never meant to have that boy arrested,
Squawtooth. Ner that other fella, either. Dave
Denmore took that all on ’imself the minute I’d
started for the inside. Course I left Dave in
authority. He didn’t know what I was workin’
on, and when the evidence that he did know about
begun pilin’ up against this pair, he thought he’d
take no chances, and pinched Daisy.”</p>

<p>“Course he did! Wouldn’t you ’a’ done the
same?”</p>

<p>Fred Glenn shook his head. “That boy’s only a
harmless nut,” he maintained. “He’s wrote the
craziest stuff you ever read all over the walls o’
his cell. Somethin’ about Moses and Aaron and
some more of ’em—one o’ these religious cranks,
I reckon.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>“I don’t know nothin’ about that, Fred, but I
know his tie was found in the mountains, and——”</p>

<p>“Yes, he told me about that tie. It was hisn.
Owned up right pronto. Said him and t’other fella’d
been in the mountains lookin’ to buy a couple spans
o’ mules, belongin’ to a party in Sycamore Grove.
They was up there on pasture. I telephoned to
Sycamore Grove from Opaco when he’d told me
that, and, sure enough, it all happened just like
he said. I know the man that’s holdin’ them mules
for sale.”</p>

<p>“And when ye left here ye didn’t suspicion him
and t’other fella?”</p>

<p>“No,” replied Glenn. “Just the same, I knew it
was his tie, ’cause I found where a tie’d been
charged to him on the books o’ the Mangan-Hatton
camp, and the clerk showed me a box o’ ties just
like that un. But I was workin’ on another trail
altogether, Squawtooth. And Dave Denmore hadn’t
oughta took things in his own hands like he did.
It was plumb loco to think of arrestin’ them two,
when they’d just come in with a string o’ mules
and things worth half o’ the sum stole from the
stage. They wouldn’t ’a’ beat it and left behind
that much prop’ty, would they? So why take ’em
up?”</p>

<p>“Course I thought of all that,” admitted Squawtooth.
“But everything pointed to this pair as the
guilty ones, and for my part I hadn’t no time to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>
reason things out. It was my girl I was thinkin’
of most. And so you don’t think them boys are
guilty after all?”</p>

<p>The sheriff shook his head. “I was on another
trail altogether,” he repeated. “Guess I oughta
told my dep’ties more; but I got a way o’
keepin’ things to myself till I get the come-alongs
on my man. I’ve found it the safest way.”</p>

<p>“Yes; yes—o’ course. But who was ye lookin’
up?”</p>

<p>“Well, us sheriffs get inside information sometimes
when a bad actor drifts into our county, just
like city policemen do. I already knew they was a
couple o’ tough nuts at this here Stlingbloke—more’n
a couple, I reckon, for that matter. But
I’d been sent word about these two, and I was
lookin’ ’em up and tryin’ to connect ’em with the
pink tie. I had the foot measurements, you know;
they was taken right where the holdup was pulled
off. I’d already measured a pair o’ shoes belongin’
to this Falcon fella at Mangan-Hatton’s, and they
didn’t fit either measurement. Then at Opaco to-day
I measured Daisy’s shoes. Nothin’ doin’ again.</p>

<p>“But when I rode to Stlingbloke and on up the
line, time your boy Mart was chasin’ me, I nosed
it out that one o’ the other parties I was investigatin’
had rode with a water wagon over to a
desert water hole west o’ the line that same day.
So I thought maybe he’d get off over there, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>
maybe there’d be some o’ his tracks in the mud
about the water. That’s why I rode over there;
but I didn’t find any tracks.</p>

<p>“Then I decided to go on to the inside with
my measurements and wire ’em to the San Francisco
police, who’d first sent me word that these
bad actors had drifted down here to Stlingbloke.
They got their records up there.</p>

<p>“So I stopped at a little camp below Stlingbloke
for that night, intendin’ to go up in the mountains
next mornin’ and bring down the boys to have ’em
ready for the arrest, then go on to the inside and
send my wire. And while I was at this camp that
night your boy, who’d been tryin’ to run me down,
rode in and give me the cover off the cigarette
papers. You know ’bout that.”</p>

<p>“O’ course. Somethin’ funny wrote on it, kinda
like you said this Daisy’d wrote in the jail.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?” The sheriff was eying Squawtooth
in surprise.</p>

<p>Squawtooth explained as best he could.</p>

<p>“M’m-m—who told you that, Squawtooth?”</p>

<p>“Why, Mart did, for one. And all your dep’ties
was talkin’ about it, but nobody could remember
just what it was that was written on the cover.
But since I’ve heard that this fella Daisy’s always
writin’ somethin’ like that everywhere he goes.
Seems he’s got a Bible name, and—oh, I didn’t
get it all straight. I was too worried, you see.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>“O’ course. But nothin’ like that was wrote on
the cover that Mart give me. And the writin’ ain’t
anything like the same as this fella done in the jail.”</p>

<p>“That’s funny. What was wrote on ’er, then,
Fred?”</p>

<p>From his vest pocket Fred Glenn removed a
blue pasteboard cigarette-paper cover and silently
passed it to Canby.</p>

<p>“Keep still about it,” he cautioned.</p>

<p>Canby opened the cover and read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Blacky Silk, Blacky Silk, Blacky Silk.</p>
</div>

<p>“Why, that’s plumb foolishness,” he decided.
“What’s Blacky Silk mean?”</p>

<p>But before the sheriff could make reply the cowman
was half out of his chair, the bit of pasteboard
held before him, his eyes wide and fastened
on it.</p>

<p>“Why, Fred!” he cried. “That—that looks like
my little girl’s writin’! It sure is. Why, man
alive, Manzanita wrote that!”</p>

<p>It required some time for Squawtooth Canby to
convince the sheriff that his troubles had not deranged
his mind. Even then the sheriff would not
believe until the cattleman had brought from the
house a packet of treasured letters, written to him
by his daughter while she was in boarding school
in Los Angeles. Then Glenn became convinced.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>“Canby,” he said, “I’m more up a tree than ever
now. Why, this here is plumb loco! Get the boy,
Squawtooth, and le’s hear what he’s got to say.”</p>

<p>Some of the search party that had accompanied
Squawtooth from the mountains were at dinner now,
and Mart, with a piece of bread and butter in his
hand, was dragged from the table.</p>

<p>On the veranda he was shown the bit of pasteboard,
and under a battery of accusatory eyes he
gazed at it open-mouthed.</p>

<p>“That wasn’t wrote on it when I give it to the
sheriff!” he cried.</p>

<p>“Who’s writin’ is this?” demanded his father.</p>

<p>A moment and Mart’s jaw was sagging lower still.
“Why, pa, that’s Little Apple’s writin’, ain’t it?”</p>

<p>“That’s what me and Glenn’s decided,” replied
his father grimly. “Now, you set down here, son,
and come clean. Tell the sheriff everything that
happened about your bringin’ this pasteboard down
and all.”</p>

<p>Mart obeyed, and when his narrative reached
the point where he had passed the cover to his
sister at dusk on the desert, and she had dropped
it, the sheriff stopped him.</p>

<p>“Canby,” he said, “if you’ll excuse me, that girl
o’ yours is a reg’lar little devil! I thought she
had somethin’ up her sleeve when I run into her at
Stlingbloke—the mare all lathered up and her actin’
kinda worriedlike. She slipped the kid a package<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>
when he handed her that pasteboard cover. Up
until then he had the cover the boys found, but what
they clawed outa the sand was one she’d fixed up
for him to give to me—this one here. And she’d
wrote ‘Blacky Silk’ in it three times. That’s what;
that’s all’s to it! Now why? But wait! You go
back to yer dinner, kid. Yer pa and me’ll thrash
this thing out.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want no more now,” objected Mart.</p>

<p>“Git!” cried his father.</p>

<p>Mart’s appetite suddenly returned.</p>

<p>“Glenn, what’s the meanin’ o’ this?”</p>

<p>“Simple, ain’t it? Your girl knew the kid had
somethin’ in that first pasteboard that would go
agin’ her feller, and——”</p>

<p>“Don’t call ’im that!”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s what she calls ’im, seems. Anyway,
she didn’t want it to get into my hands, so
she puts up a job on the kid. I see all that clear
enough. But that ain’t the funny part now. The
funny part is how she come to write ‘Blacky Silk.’
What did she know ’bout Blacky Silk?”</p>

<p>“He’d just been pesterin’ her, accordin’ to Mart,”
replied Canby. “Wait’ll I set eyes on this Jasper,
Fred. I’ll horsewhip ’im outa the country. But
that’s neither here ner there. Maybe she couldn’t
think o’ nothin’ else to write. Or maybe, bein’
sore on this hombre, she was tryin’ to make you
think he was one o’ the fellas that pulled off the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>
holdup. ’Tain’t like her, though, to try to hand
a man the worst of it just ’cause she’s sore on
’im fer sumpin else.”</p>

<p>“The devil of it is,” remarked the sheriff thoughtfully,
“that she’s right. But how in thunder did
she know! That’s ’at gets me!”</p>

<p>“What? He’s the man ye got yer eye on?”</p>

<p>“Him and his pardner, Kid Strickland—a couple
o’ bad ones all around. Here was me tryin’ my
best to hang it on Blacky Silk and t’other un, when
here comes your boy and give me that cover with
Blacky’s name on it. Then, o’ course, I had more
dope—or judged I had. And that helped send me
inside; I wanted to find out if the Frisco police
knew anything about his handwritin’. If they did,
I was gonta mail the cover to ’em. Course I thought
Blacky’d wrote his name in it, like a fella might
do, ye know, just loafin’ about some time. But the
police up there hadn’t any record, so I didn’t
send ’er.</p>

<p>“Now, looky here: How’d your girl know Blacky
Silk helped stick up the stage, Canby?”</p>

<p>Canby shook his head in mystification.</p>

<p>“Then tell me this: Who telephoned me yesterday
afternoon that maybe a little after noon to-day
your girl and <i>that</i> feller—would come from hidin’?”</p>

<p>“What’s that? You got a message like that?”</p>

<p>“I sure did. Over long distance from Squawtooth.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>“Didn’t ye get the name?”</p>

<p>“O’ course. Brown. Who’s Brown?”</p>

<p>“Dunno ’im.”</p>

<p>“Sounds phony to me. Who’d phone from here
except you folks?”</p>

<p>“Most anybody in this country. Squawtooth’s
headquarters for this neck o’ the woods.”</p>

<p>“Would your housekeeper know?”</p>

<p>“Likely; we’ll see.”</p>

<p>Squawtooth Canby stepped inside, and returned
presently with the redeyed Mrs. Ehrhart. The
sheriff questioned her.</p>

<p>“Why, Mr. Demarest and Mr. Spruce was here
two or three times yesterday,” she said. “And
once there was two more men with ’em. Then
several folks was here throughout the day. It’s
always that way. This is pretty near a hotel, you
know, Mr. Glenn.”</p>

<p>“Anybody phone?”</p>

<p>“Yes—two or three times. But I was in the
kitchen mostly. I never paid any attention.”</p>

<p>“But ye’d have to O. K. a long-distance call,
wouldn’t ye, ma’am?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“And afterward find out the charge and collect
from whoever was callin’?”</p>

<p>“Yes—I do that with strangers. But folks about
here they just ask the operator at Opaco how
much it is, and then come in the kitchen and hand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>
it to me. And when they tell the operator their
name she don’t ask me to O. K. it always. She
knows everybody about here.”</p>

<p>“Anybody pay you for a long-distance call yesterday,
ma’am?”</p>

<p>“No, sir; no one.”</p>

<p>“Uh-huh. Guess I’ll call up the Opaco operator
and see what she’s got to say about this here Brown
call.”</p>

<p>The sheriff returned presently from the telephone.</p>

<p>“She says the call was from Harry Brown, bookkeeper
for Mangan-Hatton. It was charged to
Squawtooth Ranch.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Brown’s the bookkeeper at Mangan-Hatton’s,”
Mrs. Ehrhart told him. “But he wasn’t here
yesterday. If he was, he come right in and phoned,
and I didn’t see him. He phones every day or so,
but he always knocks and comes and pays me for
the call.”</p>

<p>“Uh-huh—I see. Any strangers here?”</p>

<p>“Only the two men with Mr. Demarest and Mr.
Spruce.”</p>

<p>“What’d they look like, ma’am?”</p>

<p>“Well, one of ’em was Mr. Demarest’s driver.
He was——”</p>

<p>“The other un, please, ma’am?”</p>

<p>“A slim, black-lookin’ fella with a little pointed
black mustache. He——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>“That’s plenty, ma’am; thank ye kindly. We
won’t trouble ye any more.”</p>

<p>Canby looked into the eyes of the wizen-faced
sheriff after Mrs. Ehrhart had returned to her
arduous duties.</p>

<p>“That’s Blacky Silk,” said Glenn. “Ye see,
knowin’ we’re after this feller o’ yer girl’s—er—this
feller, I mean—he’s doin’ all he can to help
us arrest ’im, to throw suspicion offen ’imself and
The Kid. But how in thunder does he know them
two are comin’ out to-day?”</p>

<p>“Guess I ain’t gettin’ head ner tail of none of it,”
complained the cattleman.</p>

<p>The sheriff consulted his watch. “It’s fifteen
minutes after noon now,” he said. “If the boys
are through eatin’ maybe ye’d better snatch a bite
and get out with ’em, to meet your girl an’ this
feller if they do show up. You’ll want to see ’em,
o’ course, even though the boy ain’t guilty o’ the
holdup. Can’t tell ye where’bouts to look, ’cept
that whoever telephoned said they’d be comin’ outa
the mountains and makin’ for Squawtooth. That
was Blacky. What’s the big idea I don’t savvy—or
how he knows they’re comin’. But I got nothin’
to do with them. I’ll get the dep’ties, and we’ll
go for Mr. Blacky and The Kid. Them’s the
hombres I want, ’cause Frisco wired me, just before
I come out here, that the measurements I
sent ’em are the same as Blacky’s. That’s why I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>
left that Moses-an’-Aaron boy in jail at Opaco, so
long’s he didn’t seem to mind. That would make
this other pair feel safe, ye see, and they wouldn’t
be thinkin’ o’ makin’ their get-away. I’ll find ’em
at Stlingbloke, I guess. Can I get a hoss?”</p>

<p>The two men arose and were about to part when
Ed Chazzy, in chaps and spurs, came around the
house and stepped on the veranda.</p>

<p>“What was the signal for Squawtooth?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“What signal?” Squawtooth shot back.</p>

<p>“Why, a red blanket—looked like she was—was
wavin’ from the big cottonwood in the corral as
I was ridin’ across from the mountains.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know anything about any signal. What
ye talkin’ about? How long ago?”</p>

<p>“Twenty minutes maybe. It was way up high
in the tree—a big red square cloth o’ some kind.”</p>

<p>“Le’s look into this,” said the sheriff quickly.
“Everybody was at the table, wasn’t they, Squawtooth?
Couldn’t ’a’ been none o’ them.”</p>

<p>They hurried out to the stable and the corrals,
and searched all about, but found no one. Men
were resting in the yard when they returned, and
others were on the back veranda. Every man
was questioned, but all professed ignorance of any
sort of signal.</p>

<p>“Ed,” said Squawtooth to his vaquero, “you’re
cock-eyed.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>Ed shook his head. “I seen it plain,” he defended.
“Thought maybe the strays had been found
and roped and that that was a signal callin’ folks in,
that I hadn’t heard anything about.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m goin’ to Stlingbloke,” announced the
sheriff. “Signals ain’t worryin’ me. I want Blacky
Silk and The Kid. See ye later, Canby.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXII<br>

<small>BREAKING CLOUDS FOR ONE</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">ON top of the gigantic rock in the chaparral
fastness sat Manzanita Canby and Falcon the
Flunky. Overhead the sun was creeping slowly toward
the zenith. From time to time the girl lifted
the binoculars from her lap and trained them on
Squawtooth. Each time, as she lowered them, she
sighed.</p>

<p>“They’ve not found any of our messages,” she
said, “or else things wouldn’t be so quiet down
there, with noon almost here. All of the men that
just rode in from the mountains have gone into
the house—to eat, I suppose. If they were going
to signal at noon, wouldn’t they be standing around
to see if anything would happen?”</p>

<p>“I should think their curiosity might be aroused
to that extent,” replied her companion. “All in
the house, eh?”</p>

<p>“Every last one of them.” She was once more
holding the glasses to her eyes. “I might have
known there wasn’t a chance in a million of any one
finding a tumbleweed with a message in it. But
I thought that, with men scouring the country all
about, somebody surely would stumble onto one of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>
them and be curious enough to find out what had
been tied to a thing like that. There are two
automobiles at the ranch. The sheriff’s, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be discouraged yet,” he comforted her.
“Maybe they’ve sent my letter to Los Angeles, and
have not yet got a satisfactory answer. In which
case they wouldn’t signal until to-morrow at noon—or
next day, if the answer was still delayed. Perk
up, dear! You had a great scheme—too great to
fail.”</p>

<p>“There goes a lone rider toward Squawtooth—from
the mountains, I guess. Looked like Ed
Chazzy’s caballo. Yes, that’s the cream he rides.
That’s Ed, too. I—oh, there! There! They’re
signaling! Look!”</p>

<p>“You’re right. I can see a fleck of red against
the cottonwood with my naked eye. You keep the
glasses.”</p>

<p>She glued the binoculars to her eyes and watched.</p>

<p>“Sure enough! There’s a man up in the tree
with a red blanket, or something. And—yes!—there’s
another fellow standing at the foot. Everything’s
all right. But say—I guess we’re not so
notorious as we thought. Can you imagine all of
the rest of them in there at dinner? Cool! Well,
I guess we’ll have to really hold up the stage, or
do something, to wake them up. I thought perhaps
we were making a hit!”</p>

<p>“How about Mart?” he asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>“Goodness! I’d almost forgotten him. Why,
there’s no sign of him at all. Something is wrong,
Tom. The kid would never, never fail us. If
the signal were genuine, the instant it had been
raised old Podhead would be on that bronc and
riding him to a fare-you-well. It’s wrong—all
wrong! A trick! I see it all now. Oh, I didn’t
think such a thing of Pa Squawtooth! He’s refused
to give Rattle-pod my half of the letter,
and of course the kid has had no chance to read
the milk message. Oh, Pa Squawtooth! I’ll never
forgive you! And the coarseness of their work,
Tom. Even though they’re trying to fake us, they
ought to have sense enough to all stand out there
and look on. They don’t know enough to try and
make the proceeding appear natural. That alone
might scare us off, even if we didn’t know the signal
is a trap.”</p>

<p>“Not so fast,” said The Falcon. “It has just
occurred to me that perhaps your father has offered
a reward to the man who brings us in.”</p>

<p>“It would be just like him.”</p>

<p>“In that case—can’t you see?”</p>

<p>“Of course I can. The man who found the
message might be selfish enough to think nothing
of justice or our predicament, and would keep his
discovery to himself and try to lure us out so that
he—and a few pals maybe—could nab us and claim
the reward. Even though we might be able to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>
prove your innocence, and to show that eventually
we would have come out anyway, pa would be
in duty bound to pay what he’d offered. He’d do
it, too. Oh, I never thought of such a situation!
That’s just it. Somebody’s signaling unbeknown to
pa and the rest, in at dinner.”</p>

<p>“Still no Mart, eh?”</p>

<p>“No sign of him. And there the signal goes
down.”</p>

<p>Fully two minutes passed before she spoke again.</p>

<p>“There go two men away from Squawtooth over
the desert,” she finally reported. “I’ll bet they set
that signal, though I can’t make sure. Barns and
things were in the way. Ed’s nearing Squawtooth,
walking his cream.”</p>

<p>A little later: “Ed has reached the house and
turned his horse into a corral.”</p>

<p>Then: “The two who left the ranch in the other
direction are running toward a couple of horses,
some distance from Squawtooth. I saw the horses
there, but thought they were loose and cropping
bunch grass. Now I see they’re saddled.</p>

<p>“They’re on ’em! Galloping like the dickens
toward the buttes! Here come Ed and pa and—yes,
I think it’s the sheriff. They’re in the corrals
looking around. Seems almost as if they were
looking up into the cottonwood. I’ve got it!
You were right! Ed saw the signal, and asked
what it meant when he got there. And pa and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>
sheriff couldn’t answer him, and have gone out to
investigate. There go those two men, galloping
like mad! That’s funny! If they meant to get us
when we came out, why are they running directly
away?</p>

<p>“There goes Pa Squawtooth and the rest of them
back to the house. Now they’ve gone out of sight
around the house. Oh, dear! And the grub’s almost
gone! And that jack was the grandfather
of all the rabbits in these mountains! Oh, I could
just baw-awl!”</p>

<p>Then Falcon the Flunky took the glass and
looked.</p>

<p>“I guess that’s the sheriff riding with three others
in the direction taken by those two who galloped
off,” was his first report. “They’re not hurrying,
though. And now the others are getting their horses
out of the corral. Here they come straight toward
us—all in a bunch. M’m-m! I’d say everybody’s
crazy down there!”</p>

<p>A sniffle.</p>

<p>“Cheer up! Cheer up! So long as they’re hunting
over the desert there’s the chance of another
of your messages being found. We’ll sit here and
watch while they’re in sight. Maybe we can find
out what they’re up to.”</p>

<p>“If we d-don’t we’re likely to starve,” the girl
said sobbingly, wretched over the defeat of her
clever plans.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>The tents of the Jeddos that had been swept
down by the wind were up again. Jeddo the Crow
had slept throughout the greater part of the storm,
and when conscious again had been in no condition
to return to his camp from Stlingbloke to help
repair the damage. Consequently he managed to
get drunk again and forgot it.</p>

<p>On the slender shoulders of Wing o’ the Crow,
then, had descended in violence one catastrophe
after another. Her father was incapacitated, and
she was in charge of the work as well as cook and
dishwasher for the outfit. Halfaman had been arrested
on suspicion of highway robbery and the
killing of a man. On her hands he had left extra
stock to be cared for, with no one to do it or to
work them and make them earn their keep. Her
friend, Manzanita, and The Falcon were fugitives
in the mountains. Then the storm had swooped down
and devastated the camp. And Wing o’ the Crow
was only a girl of twenty-two.</p>

<p>Nevertheless the tents were up again, and everything
was put to rights. Out on the job the few
men at her command were following the teams,
with the most dependable one among them acting
as foreman. Stolidly the girl cooked for them,
fed and watered the extra teams, and then went out
to help with the dirt moving, dully wondering if
ever there would be an end to her calamities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>Then the tide of her fortunes suddenly began to
change.</p>

<p>To this wonderful little black-eyed girl at noon
came Fred Glenn, sheriff, with three deputies, on
horseback.</p>

<p>“You Miss Crow, ma’am?” he asked kindly.</p>

<p>“Miss Jeddo,” she corrected, standing in the door
of the cook tent, for she was cleaning up after the
noonday meal.</p>

<p>“Yes—that’s right. I got it wrong. Here’s a note
for ye, ma’am.”</p>

<p>“Who from?”</p>

<p>“Daisy.”</p>

<p>The envelope was dirty and not addressed. She
tore it across the end and removed a dirtier piece
of paper. She read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Wing o’ the Crow,</p>

<p>Care Jeddo Daisy and Jeddo contracters
beloved—</p>

<p>Each little itum is jake wingo and I will be back
in no time Ask the Sheriff if that aint so. Then we
will knock them in the colar together hey wingo.
You and me and some more old stifs. Im sending
you some stifs—put them on those new teems and
feed them wel.</p>

<p class="right">Phinehas Daisy Vise President<br>
Your Devoted Phinehas</p>
</div>

<p>She looked up at the wizened little sheriff. “Is it
Jake?” she asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>“Yes,” the sheriff returned. “He’ll be out soon;
maybe to-morrow.”</p>

<p>She lowered her long black lashes. “Much
obliged,” she said.</p>

<p>The sheriff flipped a finger at his hat brim, and
rode on up the line.</p>

<p>An hour later Wing o’ the Crow was out in the
borrow pit, driving a slip team, dully watching
a six-horse freighter making it in from Opaco,
when seven men came walking down the line. They
stopped and surveyed the work, then one approached
her.</p>

<p>“Hello, Wing o’ the Crow,” he ventured, grinning.</p>

<p>“Hello,” she returned.</p>

<p>“D’youse know me?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think I do.”</p>

<p>“I seen youse lots o’ times. I been on jobs wid
youse in Kansas an’ Colorado.”</p>

<p>“Oh!”</p>

<p>“How’s chances?”</p>

<p>“Chances fer what?”</p>

<p>“To go to woik. Dere’s seven of us. We
rambled out wid Demarest, Spruce &amp; Tillou’s outfit.
In Opaco I see old Halfaman Daisy in de
hoosegow, an’ he says he’s gonta be out in a
day er so, and dat dere was a mistake, and everyt’ing
like that—see? He could come right now if
he wanted to. De door of his cell was unlocked.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>
He’s nuts! And he says he’s got some new teams,
an’ he said fer me to get some o’ de plugs and
go to woik fer youse folks. Said he was pardners
wid youse an’ Jeddo de Crow now; and he wanted
me to get some reg’lar stiffs an’ help youse out. I
know Halfaman dese many years, an’ I says I’ll take
a shot at ’er. Dere’s six o’ my pals wid me—all
good plugs—all skinners.”</p>

<p>“Not stiffs! Reg’lar stiffs?”</p>

<p>“Yeah—sure. Ol’-timers. Dey all savvy Halfaman.
He’s one good scout. A plug likes to see
a stiff like Halfaman get started wid an outfit of
his own, so we said we’d help um out a little.”</p>

<p>“Well, my goodness! Stiffs never work for us.
Look at the bunch o’ hicks we got! Sure you’re
not kiddin’ me?”</p>

<p>“Lead us to Jack an’ Ned. An’ Halfaman says
fer youse to let me boss de job till he gets here
and fer youse to go read yer hist’ry in de camp
wagon and leave outside t’ings to me. I’m Schmitty—Paprika
Schmitty.”</p>

<p>“Paprika Schmitty!” she cried. “Why—why
you’ve been bossman for big outfits! I know about
you. You ain’t got any business here.”</p>

<p>“Lead us to Jack an’ Ned,” Schmitty persisted.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later seven of the ten young mule
teams were heaving into the collars, each team with
an apparently lounging stiff in rear of it. In the
snap of one’s finger almost results were being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>
doubled, and with a light heart Wing o’ the Crow
ran to the cook tent and plunged into a rearrangement
of her plans for the evening meal.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Late that evening a deputy of Sheriff Glenn rode
into Squawtooth on a tired horse.</p>

<p>Blacky Silk and Kid Strickland had seen the little
posse riding toward Stlingbloke and had grown suspicious.
They had promptly mounted fresh horses
and escaped in the direction of Death Valley. The
sheriff and the other two deputies were trailing them
as best they could, and the rider to Squawtooth had
come to notify Barstow and Dagget to be on the
lookout for the escapes.</p>

<p>Shortly before this Squawtooth and his party, not
so large now as at first, had returned from the day’s
fruitless search. Demarest and Spruce had driven
on to their new camp, but the former had promised
to drop in at the ranch in his frequent comings
and goings back and forth to see if he could be of
any service.</p>

<p>Squawtooth was discouraged. Now that the
sheriff had assured him of Falcon the Flunky’s
innocence, he was ready to make almost any concession
to get back his daughter. But no opportunity
had been offered him. His great fear was that the
two had managed to get entirely out of the country,
perhaps by crossing the mountains over obscure
trails to the coast side, and that by now they were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>
married. Try though he did, he somehow could
not believe the young man to be one who would
harm his daughter. No, whatever he might be,
he was not that kind. Not long before this, under
the stress of his great tribulation, the cattle king
had been ready to accuse the flunky of any crime.
But his brain had been overheated then, and he had
not been responsible. Now he was reasoning calmly,
and finally decided that, if it proved to be the price
of getting his daughter back, he even would consent
to a marriage, no matter if his ambitious plans
for her were entirely smashed. He loved her more
than all the wealth in the world. Nothing else really
mattered. Yes, he would sacrifice everything, pride,
money, prestige, to be able to hold her in his arms
again and know that she was safe. What a fool
he had been!</p>

<p>Next morning they continued the search, but
now the party was composed only of such Squawtooth
vaqueros as could be spared from working
the cows, and a few neighbors whose own business
was not pressing—fifteen in all, counting the cattleman
and Mart.</p>

<p>All day the search was continued, over country
which had virtually been combed before. But night
came again, and the searchers knew no more than
when they had set out in the morning. And Mrs.
Ehrhart reported that no word had come from towns<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>
on the inside, whose authorities had been asked to
look out for the missing pair.</p>

<p>Webster Canby went to bed to a sleepless night,
but was in the saddle again at the head of his
men at six o’clock.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIII<br>

<small>AMBITIONS REALIZED</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">UP in their chaparral cloister the runaways sat disconsolate
over the camp fire. Another noon had
come and gone, and this time no signal whatever
had fluttered in the tall cottonwood down at Squawtooth.
Manzanita fried the last of the bacon and
poured cold water into the coffee to settle it.</p>

<p>“It’s bacon straight,” she announced with an attempt
at a laugh. “Next meal it’ll be coffee straight.
We dare not even go out to pot a rabbit now,
with them hunting as close as they are. If we
were to shoot they’d locate us in no time at all.
With them mounted and us afoot, we’d never get
away.”</p>

<p>Falcon the Flunky nibbled at a strip of bacon
that had refused to crisp, then dropped it. It was
the last remnant of the side, and it was rancid and
fat.</p>

<p>Presently Manzanita did the same with her portion.</p>

<p>“It’s simply unfit to eat,” she said mournfully.
“I don’t think I’ll ever be able to eat bacon again
after this. Ugh! I hate it! Honestly, I’d rather
go hungry.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>The Falcon set down his coffee cup. “Dearest,”
he said, “we’ve got to get out of here. I’m innocent;
I refuse longer to subject you to such needless
discomfort. It’s getting serious.”</p>

<p>“We can’t get out,” she protested. “We could
never make it across the range; it’s fifty miles, I
guess.”</p>

<p>“We’ll go to Squawtooth, and I’ll give myself up.”</p>

<p>“You won’t! I won’t let you. Besides, I refuse
to give up. The Canbys always finish whatever they
start. I’ll get a signal of complete surrender, or
we’ll stay right here and starve.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, we’ll not!” he assured her.</p>

<p>“But we will. I say we will! You wouldn’t
desert me and go alone, Tom?”</p>

<p>“Hardly.”</p>

<p>“Then if I refuse to budge, how are you going
to accomplish it?”</p>

<p>“I’ll carry you.”</p>

<p>“Huh! Just try it!”</p>

<p>“Are we going to quarrel, dear?”</p>

<p>Her hazel eyes filled suddenly, and then his arms
went around her.</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t pay any attention to me!” she said
tearfully. “I’m so hu-hungry I’m all nerves. What
shall we do, Tom? What on earth can we do?”</p>

<p>“There, there!” and he attempted to sooth her.
“We’ll not talk any more about it now. It’s nearly
noon. Let’s be getting up on the rock to watch<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>
the ranch. Maybe we’ll get the signal to-day. If
not—well, then we’ll talk over the situation and
try to do whatever is wisest.”</p>

<p>A few minutes later they were on their masthead
rock, where the girl sat and trained the
binoculars on Squawtooth.</p>

<p>“Quiet as a church,” she gloomily reported.
“Can’t see a moving thing—not even a cat. But
that big car is there again. Wait a minute! There
go a bunch of men riding toward the ranch. Say,
they’re riding, too! Look at ’em go! What’s up?”</p>

<p>Falcon the Flunky took the glasses.</p>

<p>Sure enough, perhaps a dozen horsemen were
galloping swiftly toward the old adobe. They raced
up to the corrals, and one of them threw himself
from the saddle and ran toward the house.</p>

<p>“Something’s up,” he decided, his hand shaking
just a little. “I wouldn’t wonder if—— Here,
you take the glasses. This is your war.”</p>

<p>She squirmed to one knee and placed her elbow
on the other, steadying the binoculars on the ranch.</p>

<p>“They’re holding a conference,” she detailed.
“Now they’re all trooping into the house.”</p>

<p>For five minutes then she was silent, and he
sat gazing in admiration at her trim, tense little
figure.</p>

<p>“They’re coming out!” finally. Then suddenly
she burst forth:</p>

<p>“Tom! Tom! There’s a man climbing the cottonwood!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span>
The others are all at the foot of it, looking
up. Oh, I believe—I almost <i>know</i>! Tom,
there’s something red! It’s tied to the fellow that’s
climbing. Now—he’s up! Out on a branch! There!
Look! See it? The red blanket again—and—— Oh!
Oh! Oh! There goes the podhead on the
gray colt. It’s all right! All right! The double
signal. Good old Rattle-pod! Look at that gray
cold buck! He’s tying himself in a bow knot!
The corkscrew! And look at the old kid ride ’im!
Hi-yi! Ride ’im, cowboy! Stay with ’im, old
kid!” She was on her feet now, jumping up and
down, till her companion reached for her, fearing
she might tumble off the rock in her excitement.
She doubled up with laughter and slapped her chaps;
then she glued her eyes to the glasses once more,
but could not keep her feet still.</p>

<p>“Ride ’im, Mart!” she screamed piercingly. “Ride
’im, boy! Don’t pull leather! Ride ’im, <i>hermano</i>!
Fan ’im, Rattle-pod!”</p>

<p>She ceased suddenly, lowered the glasses, and
looked seriously into her companion’s eyes, her own
wet with glad tears.</p>

<p>“It’s all over,” she said in a tired little voice.
“They’ve surrendered, and the kid turned a double
flip-flap in the air and landed sitting up. Oh, Tom!
It’s all over! We’re going home!”</p>

<p>She half closed her eyes. Hunger and excitement
had worn her out. Her knees crumpled under her.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span>
With a bound he caught her as she began to sink,
and with a long sigh she dropped her head on
his shoulder and became a dead weight in his arms.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“Toddlebike” Todd, gentleman of the saddle, had
been the one to find the tumbleweed caught on a
greasewood bush, with a piece of yellow paper
wound about an inside branch and tied there with
a strip of white cloth. Of an investigating nature,
Toddlebike had swung his cow horse close to the
greasewood, leaned his fat body from the saddle,
and picked up the weed. A moment and he was
firing his six-shooter in air and waving his Stetson
frantically.</p>

<p>Soon an eager company was gathered around him,
and Squawtooth Canby was reading the messages
aloud.</p>

<p>His blue eyes filled as he finished, and his voice
was husky as he spoke.</p>

<p>“She’s all over, boys,” he said. “It’s pretty near
noon now. We’ll cut dust to the house and send
the signal. Don’t need to write or phone this
Winston. Anything goes now. I want my girl.”</p>

<p>They galloped swiftly toward Squawtooth, Mart
at his father’s side, begging to see the note. At
last Squawtooth handed it to him. Mart said nothing
more until they had reached the ranch, then he
remarked:</p>

<p>“Pa, they’s a secret message on that fer me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span>“What’re ye talkin’ about, son?”</p>

<p>Mart grew greatly embarrassed, with so many
grown men staring at him.</p>

<p>“They’s a secret message,” he maintained. “Me
and Little Apple used ta send lots of ’em to each
other. We wrote with milk. That little jigger in
the corner says for me to heat the paper and bring
out the secret message, pa.”</p>

<p>From the house came Demarest and Hunter Mangan,
and Demarest overheard the last of Mart’s
remarks.</p>

<p>“Let ’im heat it, Canby,” he advised. “He
knows what he’s talkin’ about. You never can
tell what these kids’ll be up to. Secret message, eh?
Say, this is gonta be good!”</p>

<p>Accordingly the curious party followed Mart into
the kitchen, where, not oblivious to his new importance
and always aided and abetted by the youthful-hearted
main contractor, the young vaquero
made use of Mrs. Ehrhart’s range.</p>

<p>After a few minutes’ heating letters and words in
reddish-brown began to appear between the lines of
Manzanita’s portion of the communication. Squawtooth
thoughtfully stroked his long beard and eyed
his young son with new and speculative interest.</p>

<p>When the message was complete Mart read it
aloud.</p>

<p>“You see,” he said, “if I hadn’t read this they
wouldn’t be smoked outa their hole, ’cause Nita<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span>
says they won’t pay no attention to the red blanket
unless I ride the gray colt out east o’ the house.”</p>

<p>“Canby, you’re the victim of desperate characters!”
cried Demarest, laughing. “There’s intrigue
and plotting going on all around you. Somebody
sent a red signal yesterday, didn’t they? The
girl and this flunky saw it, no doubt, but they didn’t
show up, did they? This young pirate is right!
There’s no tellin’ what him and that young savage
you call your daughter have been puttin’ over on all
these years! I’ll have to take you back to Minneapolis
with me when I go and wise you up a little.
You’re too slow. Put the boy on the colt and
hoist your flag of surrender. I want to see the
kid ride the bucker, anyway.”</p>

<p>“How about sending word to Winston?” Mangan
put in.</p>

<p>“No need to do that now,” Demarest answered for
Squawtooth. “Ain’t he forgiven ’em? Said he
had. And the sheriff says the pot-walloper ain’t
guilty. This fella’d never had the crust to refer
you to Winston, Canby, if he wasn’t all right. But
how in thunder comes it that he knows Winston—one
o’ the biggest engineers railroadin’?”</p>

<p>The rollicking Mr. Demarest wheeled on Mangan.
“What’s the idea, Mr. Mangan?” he said quizzically.
“You fellows been pulling off somethin’ funny out
here, so that the company sent an engineer to spy
on you? By golly, I believe it!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span>“I thought much the same thing,” admitted Hunt.
“I don’t know. There’s nothing crooked in any
camp’s work, so far as I know. I’m as much mystified
over this Falcon the Flunky as any of you.
One thing I believe, though—he’s all man.”</p>

<p>“Piffle!” retorted Demarest. “Canby and I are
goin’ to kick ’im into the middle o’ next week
when the girl’s safe. But hurry up, you folks; it’s
almost noon. Don’t stand here spillin’ words.
Darndest country I ever saw! Everybody sits
around and waits for the wind to stop blowin’ or
somethin’ like that.”</p>

<p>The signal was soon hoisted in the cottonwood,
and, to the huge delight of the big contractor,
Mart rode the unbroken colt over the desert. Demarest
roared and shouted, and his face turned from
red to purple as he laughed in his enjoyment of
the sport. Even Squawtooth Canby fell a prey to
his jovial spirits and laughed with the others. Then
Mart rose gracefully from the saddle in the shape
of a shelf bracket, and in the interest of the cause
alighted unhurt in a bunch of greasewood, while
the colt went on bucking over the desert in an
effort to pitch off the saddle, too. Mart nonchalantly
picked himself up, took a chew of squawtooth, and
limped back to the spectators, to become the possessor
of a five-dollar bill donated by the effervescent
Mr. Demarest to prove his appreciation of the entertainment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[312]</span>Then all afternoon some one remained aloft in
the tall cottonwood to announce the first glimpse of
the returning fugitives. Demarest and Mangan
stayed and tried to cheer the anxious cattleman,
but hour after hour went by with no favorable
report from the treetop.</p>

<p>Then, as evening drew near, and just as the
two contractors were about to take their leave in
disappointment, the lookout shouted down:</p>

<p>“Here they come!”</p>

<p>At once all was excitement. Men sprang into
the saddles and loped off in the direction indicated
by the watcher; but before any of them had
progressed very far a big black car rushed past
them, caroming from hummock to hummock with
alarming recklessness, with Mangan, Squawtooth
Canby, and Mart in the rolling tonneau, and
Demarest seated beside his driver.</p>

<p>“I see ’em!” Demarest crowed at last “Let ’er
out, can’t you, Charlie? Here they come! The
girl’s wavin’ her hat. She’s runnin’ ahead to meet
us! Let ’er out, Charlie! ’Sall right, Canby. Everybody
right side up, and—— Let ’er out, can’t you,
Charlie! ’Fraid o’ breakin’ her?”</p>

<p>A minute more and the big car slowed and came
to a stop, and Squawtooth Canby leaped from the
tonneau, and, with tears streaming down his rugged
face, smothered his daughter in his arms.</p>

<p>For a long time neither of them spoke. Both<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[313]</span>
sobbed and hugged each other, and then the girl
looked up with pleading, tear-dimmed eyes, begging
forgiveness. Finally Manzanita left her father’s
arms and clasped the grinning Mart. She turned
then toward the rest.</p>

<p>Philip Demarest was standing with his short, fat
legs wide apart, nodding his head up and down at
Falcon the Flunky, who was approaching him with
a hand outstretched and a glad smile on his lips.</p>

<p>“Tom Demarest!” cried old Demarest “You
infernal—— Great heavens to Betsy!”</p>

<p>“I thought I knew that black car,” said Falcon
the Flunky in his quiet way. “How’s everything,
dad?”</p>

<p>Then Manzanita danced from Mart and charged
down upon Demarest, throwing herself upon him
and clasping her arms about his neck.</p>

<p>“Hello, main squeeze!” she cried. “Kiss me!
I’m going to be your daughter-in-law!”</p>

<p>Squawtooth Canby pulled his long whiskers till
his mouth hung open, and Mart remarked: “Huh!”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“There’s so little to explain,” said Demarest as
the happy party trooped to the wide veranda at
Squawtooth. “If I’d dreamed—why didn’t I think
of it! You see, this young sprout is going to be
our general manager. He’d just finished his engineering
course, and before he took hold of the
work he got it into his head that he had no business<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[314]</span>
managing big camps till he knew the inside
lives of the men that would be workin’ under him.</p>

<p>“‘Well, son,’ I says, ‘there’s only one way to
know that, and that’s to hop to it. Take a month—two
months—six months, if you like—and live the
life with ’em from A to Z. ’Tain’t a bad idea,
either,’ I says. You see, folks, I come up from
the grade myself. I wasn’t exactly what we call
a stiff, but I’d done everything from skinnin’ mules
and bein’ powder monkey to paymaster before I had
an outfit of my own. So I thought it would do
the boy a world o’ good to get a little democracy
into him after college, and before he took hold.
And, by golly, if he didn’t hit the trail like a regular
stiff—went broke a-purpose, and all that, and
ended up flunkyin’ in a camp out West. ’Sall right;
I approve. There’s nothin’ dishonorable in service.
We oughta all learn that. Service is what makes
the wheels go round. We all want it, but mighty
few of us have learned to give it. But you oughta
written, Tom; you oughta let us know where you
were.”</p>

<p>“I wanted to go the limit, you see,” explained
his son. “I was in touch with Winston. He’d have
let you know if things weren’t all right with me.
I didn’t want to merely play stiff; I wanted to be a
stiff—a floating laborer with no money, no home,
no friends to aid him. I wanted to learn all of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[315]</span>
ins and outs of their peculiar life. I understand
stiffs now. I’ve worked with them—studied them—served
them. They’ve helped me. I’ll make a better
general manager than if I’d taken hold fresh from
college.”</p>

<p>“I’ll say you will!” proudly replied his father,
and it was easy to see that Philip Demarest thought
this boy of his one of the wonders of the world.</p>

<p>“Besides,” added the son, with an odd little touch
of satisfaction, “they’ll tell you at Mangan-Hatton’s
that I am a mighty good flunky. Eh, Mr. Mangan?
Give me my job back, won’t you?”</p>

<p>There was little time for more conversation then,
for the reclaimed derelicts were ravenously hungry,
and happy, flustered Mrs. Ehrhart called them to
the table in the midst of the merrymaking.</p>

<p>While they were at the table a telephone message
came from the sheriff to the effect that Blacky Silk
and Kid Strickland had been captured close to
Dagget and had cleared up the mystery of the
first red-blanket signal.</p>

<p>“I must see old Halfaman Daisy,” said Tom
Demarest as they rose from the table. “He’s out
of jail, of course?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes!” Mart piped up. “He come in yistiddy.”</p>

<p>“He came in, Martie,” primly corrected Manzanita.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[316]</span>For once Mart rebelled. “I wisht you’d stayed
up there in the mountains, Nita!” he complained.
“Then I could talk like I wanta. But if ye hurry
up and get married maybe I’ll get some peace,
anyway.”</p>

<p>Manzanita’s face turned scarlet, and to hide her
confusion she accused:</p>

<p>“You pulled leather to-day!”</p>

<p>“I didn’t no such thing! Did I, Mr. Demarest?
Didn’t I stick till the gray ditched me? I never
pulled, Nita. Honest. Ast anybody!”</p>

<p>It was not yet dark when Tom Demarest and his
bride-to-be walked over the desert toward the old
camp of Jeddo the Crow with Hunter Mangan, returning
to his camp.</p>

<p>As they came to the parting of the ways Mangan,
who had been noticeably silent, halted and extended
both hands to the happy couple.</p>

<p>“Congratulations,” he said. “I wish you both
all success and happiness.”</p>

<p>He dropped their hands and turned away into
the desert, and the black, cold night soon had
swallowed his solitary figure.</p>

<p>“Hard hit,” Tom Demarest muttered to himself.</p>

<p>As the two walked on and neared the stable
tent of the Jeddo camp unnoticed, they heard a
familiar voice within singing softly, and stopped
to listen.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
